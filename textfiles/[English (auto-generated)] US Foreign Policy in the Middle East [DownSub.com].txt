good so what

happened last week

a number of things

but let's start with uh Saudi Arabia

OPEC and the us all right so OPEC the

organization of petroleum exporting

countries

okay quiet please

I'll give you a moment to settle down

all right

we all here great

so last week OPEC has decided to not

increase and in fact cut oil production

which is bad for the West why because a

cut and oil production means higher

energy prices which are already very

high due to the war in Ukraine and the

sanctions right so the U.S wanted the

Saudis to actually increase oil

production so that prices would become

would go lower right

the Saudis said no which makes Biden

especially Biden because he's

part of the democratic party very angry

because they wanted to have cheaper

Energy prices before the midterm

elections right so no Biden is

threatening with uh

a stop in arms sales and other potential

measures

so what does that tell us we know

already that Saudi Arabia is or has been

the main Ally in the region of the US

right along with Israel perhaps but

potentially much more important than

Israel in geostrategic terms right but

now the south is acting Again by the way

against American wishes right in uh in

fact not increasing oil production

so the Americans are angry and the

Saudis are angry as well so just take a

look at this little video from one of

the Saudi princes so he's from within

the ruling family let's take a look at

this video

foreign

[Music]

good so just a little reminder by

the Saudis themselves that this is a

Kingdom built on the heart and martyrdom

right an Islamic State that made it and

with these words we can enter today's

discussion which is about

the U.S and the Middle East so a very

complex topic indeed we will do a little

tour of the history of the US in the

region we will cover a number of main

aspects and all of these main aspects we

will go into in a bit more detail later

on right when we talk about the Eric

Society Conflict for example or when we

talk about the Iraq Wars right

so

let's start

and let's start with the Ayatollah

so we talked about the Iranian uprisings

last week right so here's a tweet I

found by the Ayatollah

himself

you know Trump is banned from Twitter

but he can he can still tweet

I'm not going to go into all of these

tweets just this one

this is harmony I quote I openly state

that the recent riots and unrest in Iran

were schemes designed by the US the

usurping fake Zionist regime their

mercenaries and some treasonous Iranians

abroad to help them

wow so there you have your explanation

for the Iranian Uprising from the

Ayatollah Harmony right so quite quite a

mind-boggling uh quotes I should say

right because we can safely say that the

uprisings in Iran are uprisings against

political repression by the regime that

this man

um

represents right and we've talked last

session about the facile

anti-imperialism

of Islamic fundamentalism right we

traced this back to alafghani and we

looked for it in the speeches of the

first

Ayatollah Khomeini and now we find it

here as well

so this being said there is a lot to

criticize about U.S imperialism in the

Middle East at North Africa right but we

cannot criticize or in fact complement

the U.S for the uprising in Iran that is

something Iranians are doing by

themselves right

but I'm putting this

I think rather outrageous quote out here

because when critically analyzing the

American role in the Middle East and in

fact elsewhere

you have to be critical right but beware

of this idiotic type of anti-imperialism

right which blames the US for everything

that's bad which is going on right it's

a very very

facile a very easy excuse for dictators

and other repressive rulers to blame

everything on the US all right so with

this in mind let's go into the topic and

I will entertain questions later

you don't need to be the Ayatollah to be

critical about the American role in the

Middle East here's a tweet that is a bit

older I recommend if you're on Twitter

to follow Carl sharrow he is a very very

funny very clever man from Lebanon right

and here's a tweet by Martin indict

who's been you know a high level uh

Diplomat to the israel-palestine

so-called peace process and indigrides

or in the senior Biden officials

official before POTUS calls Xi Jinping

or call XI Japan was a phone call The

Lion's Share of the history of the 21st

century is going to be written in the

Asia Pacific that perfectly captures

Biden's priority focus on Asia bye bye

Middle East until next time and he

quotes foo foo how do you say you know

he's uh he's a

he is happy that the US is is leaving

right relieved

so to say

um

but the Middle East of course remains

important also in the American Chinese

competition or in the American focus on

Asia right the Middle East remains

important right if only for reasons of

the oil Market

um alone

thanks

so

but this captures a widespread sense

that the American role in the region

hasn't been beneficial right and we will

take a look um at this American role

right now so how does it integrate into

what we've talked about so far

we have talked about how Mina was

integrated into the global system via

the post World War One settlement

then we talked about Arab nationalism as

one solution to the problem of autonomy

and development

we talked about the failure of Arab

nationalism and we talked about how

Islamic fundamentalism

filled in the voids left by that failure

right so when we now look at the U.S

what we have to look at is the

relationship of the U.S with Arab

nationalism and with Islamic

fundamentalism right we have to look at

the interplay between the two okay this

is our role

and we have to try to take a

dispassionate look at the American role

in the Middle East and North Africa

now of course this is a big topic and

we'll move from basically

1945 until today right and we'll try to

capture the big elements of the story of

the US in the region and we try to ask

the main questions political questions

historical and conceptual questions that

you want to ask

because otherwise we'll get lost in

detail and this is how we do it

first

we will look at the Cold War

and for the Cold War three things are

important

first of all oil

secondly communism and then thirdly

Israel we will look at these three

factors in U.S foreign policy during the

Cold War or in fact until the mid 1970s

Because by the 70s I would argue the

Soviet Union was out the Cold War ended

I'll tell you why

ended in the Middle East okay

then we will take 1979 as a cut-off

Point 1979 is one of the really

important years in post-war 20th century

history okay a number of things happened

in 1979 in the Middle East and elsewhere

we will mostly look at the Iranian

Revolution

and we will look at the Soviet invasion

of Afghanistan which sped up the process

of Soviet disintegration right it led to

a Soviet Vietnam in Afghanistan okay

which is what the Americans very much

desired

and then we'll take a look at the post

called War era

directly after the Cold War

1990s the U.S is the only game in town

it is at the peak of its hegemony right

I don't think in this room anybody

remembers the 1990s Mike we do the US

was dominant right very different to its

role in the region today right uh where

it cannot imposes will not even on Saudi

Arabia as we've just seen okay the

question is why and that's a question we

will address also when we talk about the

war on terror Iraq Afghanistan

so let's look at the Cold War first

of all

what was the Cold War it's important to

know what it was because we're living in

another cold war at the moment right so

it's worthwhile to study the old Court

War to draw some lessons for today's

Cold War

the Cold War was about two things and

historians and politicians and political

scientists and so on argue about which

thing was more important but it was

about systemic rivalry and it was about

geopolitical influence right so a

systemic rivalry between the two systems

obviously of Communism and capitalism

all right we do not have that type of

rivalry today because the whole world is

capitalist right so economically it's a

rivalry perhaps between different kinds

of capitalism but not even that I'd

argument different topic

geopolitics and influence in the Middle

East right if I don't own this country

you own this country right uh zero-sum

game over the Middle East that we look

at

the problem with the Cold War for

everybody that wasn't in the west of the

Soviet Union was that it didn't actually

uh concern them right

but then it did concern them of course

because the Soviet Union and the US were

concerned about them

you understand what I mean for Egypt for

Syria

and the problem wasn't am I going to be

communist or capitalist the problem was

how do I develop right how do I become

sovereign the questions that we already

discussed so for the whole Global self

the Cold War

was a distraction from its actual goals

of

proper decolonization right so when you

study the Cold War outside of the west

of the Soviet Union what you have to

study is the interplay the intersection

between

Global self struggles and goals and the

Cold War right so Vietnam would be a

case in point important in the backdrop

for what we're studying here as well

so studying the cold warming studying

this intersection and it means thinking

about how this intersection applies to

the Middle East right

um and we've talked about the sewers War

talked about a few things we will talk

about these things again today so we

always come back to the stuff that we've

already learned

when you

think about the American role after

World War II it's worth remembering the

American impression in the region after

World War one right after World War One

or during World War One the Americans

were seen in a rather positive light in

the region right because they stood for

self-determination

Woodrow Wilson's 14 Points promised just

that for the regions of the Ottoman

Empire right self-determination which is

exactly what Britain and France

prevent it from happening right so

Britain and France very bad reputation

the U.S not so bad at all right this

however changes after World War II as

the U.S begins to engage in the region

and why does it engage why does it begin

to

influence the middle east's Affairs to

an extent

to a great extent right to an extent

that is very very hard for to extricate

itself

um today

and the answer can be found for example

in this Council and Foreign Relations

report from 1958 that is quoted in your

textbook

an article titled defense of the Middle

East or like a report on the defense of

the Middle East

and the author writes

the entrenchment of Soviet power in that

strategic region would bring a decisive

shift in the world balance outflanking

NATO

Soviet control of Middle Eastern Oil

could disrupt the economy of the three

worlds and the Triumph of Communism and

the Heart of the Islamic world could be

the Prelude Prelude Prelude anyways to

its Triumph through Asia Africa and

Europe so the idea here very clearly

stated all is a strategic commodity we

look at what that means strategic

commodity it's not what you may think it

means

foreign

and because it's strategic because the

region is strategic

the U.S has to wield influence not the

Soviet Union right by the way the reason

that we talk about the USC modern the

Soviet Union is that the U.S was able to

wield more influence in the region right

if it happened the other way around this

class would be called uh

foreign policy of the Soviet Union

so this is how oil and communism are

integrated right it's sort of the same

goal you want to control Middle Eastern

Oil before the Soviet Sue right and we

look at how that exactly plays out the

importance of oil and what it means

which is something we will in fact look

at in much more detail I think it's next

week

so why is also important

after World War One or during World War

one but especially after World War II

the global economy switched from coal to

oil right remember coal powered

Britain's industrialization right in the

19th century and now the new strategic

commodity are the crucial ingredients

for industrialized economies is oil if

you look at the US

the U.S Imports in the 1970s about half

of its oil

and half of that half 25 comes from the

Middle East

in fact this period during the oil shock

is the moment that the U.S most depends

on outside supplies we'll take a look at

this history

um later and for Europe it is in fact a

lot

more I've written down the numbers so

let me quote from Daniel Jurgen who is

the authority

on that subject in 1955 Cole provided 75

percent of total energy use in Western

Europe and petroleum just 23 percent

this is post World War II in the

immediate uh postwar by 1972 Cole's

share had shrunk to 22 percent while

oils had risen to 60 almost a complete

flip-flop right so when you have a

change in the energy mix

um you know about this future change

also early on right right now we already

know that we have to switch to Green

otherwise we're doomed right

um but we're not there yet but we're

moving there hopefully right

um so it was very clear after World War

II before that in fact during World War

II that oil would be the big commodity

the big price of the future right and

that materialized over the post World

War II decades so that in the 1970s

Europe couldn't do without Middle

Eastern Oil right

just as German today can't really do

without Russian energy right which is

why the German economy is a little bit

doomed and Europe in general

now today

the U.S is energy independent it can

produce enough energy oil and gas a lot

of it through

um the Shale oil revolution of the

fracking technology to be independent

right theoretically

um

which means that the US doesn't need

Middle Eastern oil for itself today

so why would Saudi Arabia still be an

important Ally does that make any sense

I mean the US doesn't need the oil

they objectively don't

um

yes exactly it's basically if you

control or if you have if you you know

play a large part in controlling Global

energy supplies you obviously

obviously this helps in being the global

hegemon right it helps in controlling

other things too if you encro the if you

control the basic ingredients of

industrialized economies right so this

is what strategic commodity means it

means being able to tell the Saudis to

increase production so that Russia

suffers right that is a strategic

commodity

and the fact that the US isn't able to

tell the Saudis to do that or that the

Saudis are doing their own thing this

tells you something right it's quite a

dramatic shift right but this is what

all as a strategic commodity means so

the sort of like popular imagination

around this topic often is that well

the Western Country goes somewhere to

seal the oil right

um

but it's more complicated than that

right

um

so the the reason why the U.S so

interested in in Gulf oil

um is because

The Leverage control over the oil Market

gives you right something we'll get into

next week a lot more now for the Soviet

Union

like it's a bit strange because for the

Soviet Union oil actually isn't an issue

right the Soviet Union always has had

enough oil and gas to supply itself

right so for the Soviet Union which did

not want to extend its Empire oil wasn't

a strategic commodity at all right I

mean after a certain

basically

um

after the post-war years were over with

the Soviet Union did not seek expansion

it's it's sought stabilization right

which meant it didn't need oil right so

this makes the whole oil thing a little

bit weird right and there's an argument

to be made that maybe you can just drop

the whole relationship with the Saudis

right we'll talk about that next week in

fact

um but oil is there's an obvious

importance attached to it but it's also

a strange topic right

so the way I think about it is you

cannot look at the U.S role in the

region without thinking about oil right

but if you reduce everything to oil then

you're being reductionist right then

you're only seeing one thing and you're

not seeing other important things

ideologies

um path dependencies and just sort of

like bizarre

policy failures as well in fact

so as we've just seen Saudi Arabia of

course contradicts the whole

democratization discourse right it is

very clearly a

a fundamentalist authoritarian regime

right so that's the main argument

against

um

sort of American pretensions to you know

be working for democracy in the region

well what about Saudi Arabia right why

the

why is Iran the adversary and why Saudi

Arabia the French right you could you

could just switch

you could just switch it or make you

know make both your enemies or friends

or whatever so

um again that's a one of the yeah big

questions that I think the byte

Administration is asking itself uh as we

speak basically

Okay so we've identified

these two main interests beating back

communism and controlling the oil

markets so how does that play out how

does it work

and it makes sense if you look at two

big countries and compare U.S policy to

them right so let's first look at Iran

Iran in 1951

democratically elected

mosadec

um a nationalist prime minister

who wanted to have a larger share of the

country's oil production because back

then or after World War II it was in

fact Britain that had the main or the

major control over Iranian oil

production right the Anglo

um Iranian oil Consortium

is the predecessor to none other than

British Petroleum BP we all know okay

so Muscle X says look

um you know we want a bigger cut

basically right

um for Britain

this was seen as impossible because most

of British or in fact a lot of all that

were circulating in Western Europe came

from Iran right so strategically for

Britain that was a no-go right so what

happened I think you all know the story

um Britain and convinced the US

um namely the the CIA

to organize the coup against mosadec

right

um that's the big story in 1950s Iran a

British U.S coup against mossadec one of

the reasons why conspiracy theories

still have uh can Echo so well right

this is one reason why Harmony can say

these things and sort of I don't think

you can get away with it now but like

get away with it at least in the ears

and eyes of some people because they

have been these kind of Crews right

these backdoor sort of uh coups um back

then this type of like meddling in a

particularly Sovereign Nations so muscle

deck is overthrown and the Shah is

reinstated right and what happens is

that Iran

becomes an authoritarian country

that modernizes quite rapidly but that

modernization benefits of course the

elite much more than anybody else so you

have critical repression

um a brutal secret police and economic

inequality and you know this Patron

client related with the US very politely

that will all work together to culminate

in the Iranian Revolution

um later

later on

and ironically under the Shah Iran did

as you receive a much larger cut of its

oil production right with the remaining

share being divided between the US and

Britain right so this is before the

1970s era of all nationalization

um

but again we talk about next week so

here the interest in beating back

communism and controlling the oil leads

to a direct coup d'etat right

um because mozadek he he was not

unpopular with the Soviets right

um so this all worked together to create

this intervention this action right so

this is let's say different in spirit

from the 14 points of Woodrow Wilson

right rather different

post World War II compared to post World

War One

good so what happens with NASA

we talked about that

so you've done Iran now you move over to

another big player in the region Egypt

right which is nowhere near as allridge

of course but strategically located at

the Suez Canal and this influential

power

in the Middle East we talked about this

already just to remind you that when

Britain France also Israel decided to

attack Egypt

what did the U.S do

it called off the attack right in 1950

uh six right

um so there it actually you know acted

against this old Imperial

um or the old imperialist style of

Europe and the question is why so why do

you do a coup in Iran but why do you

help NASA uh in his political victory of

the sewers War right so why what

explains this like contradictory looking

policy and the reason is that the game

that the US was playing at the time was

rather complicated so

gaining influence overall beating back

communism meant that you also had to not

appear as openly colonialists in the

eyes of the Arab nationalists right who

were so anti-western so

anti-imperialists so anti-colonialist

that

um any type of like open Move

you know would have just solidified this

hostility right

um so this is why the U.S couldn't allow

itself to openly back the sewers War the

sewers intervention right

um so here again things that look

contradictory to the outside are bizarre

make sense when you know about the

underlying policy rationale right then

things that look weird make sense all of

a sudden when you know what both of

these policies

were actually about Okay so we've used

Iran and Egypt to talk about oil and

communism

in the Cold War where does Israel fit in

because when people think about the U.S

role in the Middle East they think about

Israel because the U.S is Israel's most

important uh Becca right most important

external Ally so how does this third

interest fit in

before 1967

Israel was a rather inconvenient Ally

for the U.S and by inconvenience

I mean what I just said

um before if you openly back Israel

You're Going to attract the hostility of

Arab nationalist States right it doesn't

help in your anti-impulist image

if you support a country that is seen to

be

if you support the deal or not doesn't

matter that is seen to be an imperial

Outpost in the region

so that's the key problem and this is

why before 67

Washington did not in fact Supply Israel

with heavy arms right there was a bit of

like defensive Weaponry but overall the

Israeli state was not a recipient of U.S

military aid right in fact France was a

lot more important and ironically none

other than West Germany who supported

Israel with um economic Goods through

the reparations agreement with financial

aid and with weapons right so in fact

Europe is more important to Israel and

military terms than the us before 67.

so what changes in 67

what changed

well quite clearly

um what Israel managed to achieve in 67

was a decisive Victory against Arab

nationalism right so for Israel that war

was a war of

preemptive self-defense you could say

right so this was a war to

prevent or win the next round of Arab

Israeli Warfare that was seen as

inevitable right that was the Israeli uh

like sort of

uh perspective

um but of course from a cold war

perspective a regional war between the

Arab states and Israel had a totally

different

um different meaning right the meaning

of again beating the Arab nationalists

under NASA

and this is when Israel becomes you know

the biggest

recipient of American military aid in

the world so it's not directly after 67

in the years that follow

um you know the the the eight would

amount to three to three point five

billion US dollar per year which is

enormous right so basically after 67 and

especially

um after 73

the U.S makes sure that Israel cannot be

defeated militarily in the region right

that is the core of the relationship

making sure that the country cannot be

defeated militarily

again the Arab Israeli conflict is a

topic we will cover in much more detail

later

than other factors that contribute to

the very special place that Israel holds

an American foreign policy also European

and German foreign policy is identity

factors

um right it's seen as a western state

it's seen as a response to the Holocaust

and it's seen as a defender of Western

interests in it geologically important

region the problem of course is that the

unresolved Palestine conflict leads to

hostility to the us as well right so the

relationship with Israel contributes to

anti-American sentiment in the region

and the more time goes by that you

cannot you know solve the conflict

I think now we've gotten like people

have gotten used to it but you know it

contributes to to to the sentiment

um

that the American role is not a good one

in the region and of course now that the

US openly supports Israel this gives a

very easy opening to the Soviet Union

right which is just going to play on

anti-imperial anti-israel sentiment and

support Israel's adversaries so between

67 and 73

um the Arab Israeli conflict is the most

Cold War

has the most Cold War characteristic

right with the Soviet Union supporting

Syria and Egypt

and um Israel being supported by by the

U.S

and I just want to close on this topic

with a little quote

and this is from the German foreign

office archive so that we not only talk

about the US right so on the day that

Egypt accepts the ceasefire that ends

the war of 1967

the German ambassador in Washington

writes to back home towards Germany

about the satisfaction in the U.S

Congress of the military victory of the

Israelis and thus the victory of the

West which was not expected to be of

such magnitude and such swiftness right

so the 67 victory was seen as a victory

for the West against the Arab

nationalist states that were seen to be

in the Soviets

camp

good last slide and then we have a quick

break

so let's turn this picture on and look

at the Soviet Union all right

so the Soviet Union starts in the Middle

East with lesser influence in the U.S

on the ideological level there is of

course some appeal

right anti-imperialism is a good thing

right the problem is that communism

doesn't mix very well with Arab

nationalism even though you know regimes

turned Arab socialist to go full

hardcore Communists was still a

different question right

and of course atheist communism doesn't

go very well with Societies in which

religion plays a big role right even if

you're not part of the Muslim

Brotherhood

um you know

becoming

a Soviet atheist still a different

different question right it's basically

asking you to replace your religion with

a new secular religion right that's a

big ask

and this is why the Soviet Union made do

with nationalist regimes right so okay

if we can't get real Communists we'll

you know we'll arrange ourselves with

NASA and the bath party

and so on

but the problem is that these regimes as

we just mentioned get decimated get

humiliated in 1967.

right and Egypt is the first country to

realize who will win the Cold War so in

1972 And this is important Egypt kicks

out the Soviet advisors right before it

goes to war with Israel

so buy a 72 Egypt and asadat NASA's

successor makes the decision to switch

sides in the Cold War right play with

the winning team you know why continue

playing with the losing team right make

sense very much real politique

of course Egypt

gets a lot of hostility for that in the

region gets kicked out of the Arab

League

and loses its traditional leadership

position right but um it chooses The

Winning Side in the Cold War

which means that Syria will be the

remaining Ally of the Soviet Union until

the end of the Cold War right and

interestingly today again right because

Russia in 2015 redeploits in Syria right

so there's uh there's that

and Russia backed the Assad regime in

Syria

and then we'll talk about this a bit in

a bit the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan

in 79 even though Afghanistan isn't part

of the Middle East technically speaking

I mean it's a construct anyhow right

um but

neighbors it

that will lead to a contribute to the

overstretch of the Soviet Empire

okay shall we take a break until 20 Past

yeah

so we are now in the

we are now in the 1970s

okay

quite an important it's sort of a weird

decade because like people think about

the 1960s 1968 and so on right in the

70s or so you know what happened in the

70s but they're really important

so in 1970 that's the year that

NASA dies and it's also the year that

Arab nationalism more or less dies right

by the late 60s the right wing of the

bath party takes over in Iraq

um in Syria the Assad Clan comes to

power that we have in power until today

uh we talked about Gaddafi in Libya are

ready so this is the year that you know

nationalism really Fades from View and

Islamic fundamentalism begins to to take

over

it's also the decade in which the cold

war ends in the Middle East You could

argue right because as we've mentioned

the Egyptians or the Sadat government

kicks out the Soviet military advisors

in 1972 right

which means that Syria really is the

only real Ally left at the Soviet Union

has

there is a war between

Israel Syria and Egypt mainly in 1973

when Syria and Egypt attack Israel right

so contrast to 67 and Israel wins but

only because of American age right so

this is the war that is the most Cold

War type of war in the Arab Israeli

conflict right without American Aid

things would have been different right

but it does show again that Israel is

not going to lose it's not going to go

away right when you have when it has

America on its sides

negotiations begin between Israel and

Egypt over a peace agreement so Sadat

goes to Jerusalem and holds a speech in

the knesset the Israeli Parliament right

this is one of the big 1970s sort of

like images

there is also the oil shock right so oil

had been we look at this in detail next

week okay basically all have been really

cheap then you have the war and then

Arab all producers decide to increase

oil prices right by boycotts and

production Cuts right so you have a huge

increase in the oil price and the era of

cheap growth in Europe and the US is

over right the 70s is when the whole

post-war boom ends and this has a lot a

lot to do with the rise in the oil price

right I mentioned Germany the German era

of export-led growth is over because the

era of Russian energy is over right so

Germany will be poorer in the next

decades all right or

grow less at least let's see I actually

have no idea but it's not good for the

economy

for the US which is itself a major

producer of oil the shock is easier to

digest right it's much more it's much

harsher on the Europeans on Germany on

Japan which you know have grown to be

you know Siri

semi-serious competitors to the US right

and also it elevates the power of Arab

oil producers especially Saudi Arabia

right so the growth of Gulf Power is

comes in the 70s right before that it

was the era of the power of the Arab

nationalists now the oil producing

states they have the power power really

shifts towards the oil producing

countries

right

the 1970s are the decade of oil

nationalization we've talked about Iran

and how its oil was in fact or the

profits of its oil production went

mostly first the Britain and then the US

and Britain right

um

the in the 70s Arab states nationalized

the oil Industries

to be talked about next week

what changes geostrategically is then

quite a lot so Egypt by the time of the

peace agreement in 79 will become a U.S

Ally on the on the southern flank right

Israel is an ally on the western flank

Saudi Arabia and Iran this is before 79

or around 79 are allies to the east

right and then you have turkey which is

a NATO member in the North

so things are looking a lot better for

the US in the Middle East than they do

in Southeast Asia right remember this is

the time of the Vietnam War so you have

to also think about the Vietnam War when

you think about the Middle East in the

1960s and 70s

so just a quick look on the map what

does it mean this is before Iranian

Revolution right so

the fact that Egypt signs a peace deal

means that Israel cannot be attacked

from two sides

right so

Jordan is very happy with that

um because it never wanted in into the

whole like hostility right

um and yeah so it leaves Syria in a way

right so this you could argue ends the

Arab Israeli conflict right because

since after the this agreement or this

peace deal you didn't have a multi-front

war against Israel right didn't happen

right

um so yeah so this is obviously a major

development

this is an ally Saudi Arabia Iran is an

ally turkey is an ally so this leaves

Syria and uh Iraq sort of like in the

middle like squished in the middle right

so there's things are looking good from

a geostrategic perspective but of course

they change when

Iran turns from client state to

adversary right and also the Soviet

invasion into Afghanistan over here

at first doesn't look so great from the

Cold War mindset and if you remember the

Cold War mindset was crazy right think

about the Cold War mindset when you

think about today's Cold War mindset as

well right paranoia and bounded uh

during that time and my recommendation

that you watch Doctor Strangelove by

Stanley Kubrick in 1960s movie on the

nuclear bomb very very timely very

current very very current Dr Strangelove

my movie recommendation for the week

okay so this is the 1970s um and in 79

things change due to the Iranian

Revolution

and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan

but other things happen in 1979 as well

so first of all the aforementioned peace

deal between Egypt and Israel

right

then also in Saudi Arabia islamist

militants take over the grant mosque in

Mecca which is a sign of things to come

so Saudi Arabia

when you look at the history of its

foundation is an Islamic fundamentalist

state right but the fact that it is

allied with the US that it has that it

holds a U.S Air Base

um that attracts the hostility of the

pure jihadis right Bin Laden for example

we will meet later

and Saddam Hussein becomes Iraq's

dictator

Undisputed Soul dictator in 1979 right

very anti-American so this is all like a

bit worrying from Washington's

perspective but the Iranian Revolution

and the Soviet invasion are the two big

ones

now one I think the Arab SD conflict is

a bit too popular in the west at least

and in the west we forget about other

Wars right I'm not sure about Hong Kong

how things work over here but when I

give this class and say Germany there's

a lot of students who don't know about

the iran-iraq war which raged from 1980

to 1988 right that's eight years of war

between Iran and Iraq

a million or so people died right

chemical warfare

included a terrible horrifying war that

didn't change any of the borders between

two countries right so it had no effect

whatsoever on

the borders of these countries anything

else it just bled both countries dry

much more Iranians died than Iraqis Iraq

felt I'm not Saddam that they could

cut out a huge chunk of the oil

producing bits of Iran by the Persian

Gulf that didn't work also thanks to

[Music]

um

ideological factors in that war

on the Iranian side

um so a bloody drawn out senseless War

which if you think about this in very

Machiavellian terms

is Good from Washington's perspective

right so this is as bad as International

politics gets so the U.S supports Iraq

right it wants to make sure that Iraq

doesn't lose the war

it doesn't want to ensure that Iraq wins

it you know but it Iraq cannot lose the

war because that would you know of

course increase Iran's power influence

right at the same time

and this is proper cold war Thriller

stuff via the so-called Contra deal

um Iran also gets a few weapons

um so this is a cynical uh game

um or cynical geostrategy that leaves

both of these great adversaries of the

US weakened right

the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan is a

classical case of Imperial overstretch

right the idea to prop up a communist

government

in Afghanistan is not going to work and

if you look at the

Soviet one Afghanistan

it actually failed in quite similar ways

than NATO's war in Afghanistan right

unable to build a state unable to extend

influence Beyond Kabul unable to fight

down an Insurgency

of mujarin Fighters that were

indistinguishable from the general

population fish in the water as Mao

would have called them so

the Soviets fail in Afghanistan not

least to American support of the

mujahideen of course right so there's a

huge operation of supporting the

fighters against the Soviet Union which

contributes to the Soviet loss after 10

years of war in Afghanistan so I think

NATO managed 20 years of world

Afghanistan the Soviet managed 10 both

lost

so this is 1979 this is why 1979 is

important let's fast forward a little

bit

to the end of the Court War so basically

for our purposes the cold war ends now

right in the late 70s in the Middle East

so let's move to when the Cold War

actually ended

we have mentioned the 1990s were the age

of American power if you want to be

use realist terms it's the age of

unipolarity if you want to use slightly

more critical terms it's the error of

hegemony right whatever you use they

both mean the same the same thing as

things speaking of Brzezinski had said

influential security

um advisor

in the US and no power had ever been as

powerful since the fall of Rome and this

materialized in the Middle East so let's

look just briefly we revisit this at the

post Cold War goals of the US in the

region

and then let's see what happened to them

because if you want to understand the

American role in the region today

it's of course worthwhile to go back to

the sewers crisis or to mosadec right

but it's even more worthwhile to go back

to the Post Court War period okay

so in the 90s we see three things

basically first there's the Gulf War

against Iraq so Iraq tries to Annex

Kuwait

the Americans assemble a grand Coalition

of countries

and decimate the Iraqi Army in a show of

American

hyper power

the goal then becomes the Dual

containment of the two big adversaries

Iran and Iraq so these form the

you know the major polls of anti-us

policy in the region right along with

Syria to some extent but these are the

two big players that need to be

contained

and then you have the Oslo Peace process

between Israel and the and the PLO which

doesn't work we have a whole session on

that on why there's no two-state

solution to that conflict all right so

basically these three things so

the US is at the peak of its influence

in the region

which totally declines until today right

we have no two-state solution

um we have Saudi Arabia you know that

doesn't listen to the US the U.S cannot

oppose its will in Iraq it's just one

amongst different players in Iraq same

thing in Syria right so it's unable to

unilaterally impose what it wants in the

region it's one player amongst many

right in the whole current breakup of

authoritarian order so we have to add to

all of this the Arab revolves and their

Fallout which we'll do towards the end

of this class with all of this stuff

sort of culminates

and so this is the question you have to

ask yourself why the decline in power

after the Cold War okay

and one way to do this is to look at

Iraq so Iraq after the Cold War

represents the Zenith and the Nader

Nadia I'm sorry my anxious so bad of

American power right this is when the

U.S demonstrated its hyper power and

also when it showed its decline right in

Iraq how you have to look at the two

Wars

against Iraq the first one

in 1991

was a huge display of U.S military power

right remember the U.S had lost in

Vietnam right it had lost against a

wreck Tech band of insurgents right it

can't win insurgencies but it can win

classic Wars right Wars between states

so Iraq by that time

has the fourth largest army in the world

right it's a powerful State the State

Building in Iraq was hyper authoritarian

but it did in fact work right

by the end of the war it's uh

you know the Army is almost gone right

so the USB decimates the Iraqi Army

however Saddam Hussein is left in power

right the U.S doesn't go for Baghdad it

doesn't want to brawl itself in a regime

change sort of War right which you know

if you think about the Iraq one 2003 was

of course a prudent

um decision

however when we talk about this first

God of War you have to also mention the

uh sanctioned regime that was put on

Iraq after this war which according to

U.N estimates killed sir more than half

a million people because medical

supplies were not allowed into the

country and crucial infrastructure

supplies were not allowed into the

country so the sanctions regime was

extremely uh brutal that was put in

place after this war

all right

then the next Iraq War is fought in 2003

right as a response to 9 11 right I mean

of course Iraq you know

none of this defends Saddam Hussein it

was a cruel dictator of obviously was

um but Iraq had nothing to do with 9 11

right we know that but um Iraq was

attacked Saddam was disposed of and then

there was the attempt to rebuild Iraq

built a liberal state right we will talk

about how that went down not very well

right so Iraq

presents both the peak of American power

and the absolute not absolute the

relative decline of it

in

the region also beyond that region right

if you want to like pinpoint

the relatively kind of American power uh

in recent decades I would say first the

financial crisis of 2008.

and then equally that was the economic

sort of like decline of sign of Decline

and the Iraq War on its Fallout 2003

and after right well these are two key

markers of

the downward Trends in American

influence in the world so Iraq complete

disaster weapons of mass destruction

didn't exist

um fighting terrorism the opposite

happened out of the Iraqi Civil War

emerged Isis right the most horrible

incarnation of Islamic fundamentalism to

date freedom and liberalism instead you

got sectarianism and civil war in Iraq

and then also geopolitical influence

not really because Iran is now extremely

influential in the Shia majority state

of Iraq right this is all stuff that we

cover in more detail later okay so you

don't so I just I'm just rushing over a

little bit but Iraq is important to

analyze or to answer the key question

that we asked about the decline in

American power
