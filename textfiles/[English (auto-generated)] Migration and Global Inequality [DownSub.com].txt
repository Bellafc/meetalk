the topic of international migration is

very closely linked to the topic of

international

inequality right i mean if you flee war

if you flee conflict you flee

violence right but the majority of

migration

is by people who seek better

opportunities

so we need to talk about inequality

because the idea of labor migration is

to move from a place of little

opportunity to larger opportunity right

and we do know that we've learned

that

the big bang of industrialization is at

the core of global inequalities right so

it was in the 19th century or maybe a

little bit before that europe that the

west really took off through

industrialization through modern

capitalism and this

great divergence is at the heart still

of global inequalities and

here i am relying on the writings by

branco milanovic who we've encountered

in

all of my classes a few times

so

this is the great diversions now

globalization or what some call

neoliberalism

in the recent decades has not led to

greater conversions at least not between

the poor and the the rich parts of the

world capital tends to flow between rich

countries and technological catch-up is

hard when rich countries protect their

technologies right so globalization has

not made the world more equal the

equalization that has taken place is via

the rise of china which has reduced

global inequalities to some extent

uh actually to you know quite a

substantial

extent and the rise of india all right

and then also other

asian

developers but really the rise of china

is fundamental to the reduction in

global inequality that does exist more

on that

later

now there's a really interesting finding

in the field of inequality studies and

that is that citizenship is in fact the

major factor determining your income

levels right so it's where you are

in the world of nation states not where

you are within your country in terms of

class that determines how much you will

have what does it mean basically a

person that is well off in tanzania

would be rather poor when measured

against income levels of course

purchasing power parity um adjusted in

the us right so basically

well of people in poorer countries you

know not making it towards you know the

level of poor country poorer people in

in richer countries right so it's not

your position within the national

classes but your position

within the world of nation states that

is most determinant of your income the

biggest predictor of your income and

citizenship of course is a form of fate

you know there's nothing you can do

about your citizenship another really

important factor determining how much

you will earn is who your parents are

what connections do they have what

networks what are they giving you what

in terms of education what terms of

capital right that is also important the

most important however is citizenship

and that means that hard work will only

get you so far because your place of

birth

is so important for your income

level

let's look at this graph it's a little

bit complicated

and the calculations behind are nothing

that i would want to

endeavor to do this is taken from branco

milanovich's book called global

inequality that you see

here so this graph back to the graph

this graph shows the share of between

country

inequality and global inequality global

inequality is basically

inequality within

countries plus the inequality between

countries right so these two

in country and between country

inequality they make up global

inequality

right and as you can see here from this

graph in milanovic

from

the 19th century onwards until

the the late 20th century

and global inequality or inequality

between countries was constantly rising

and became the biggest part of

uh global inequality right i mean look

at the time before industrialization

before industrialization inequalities

between countries weren't really high

because most countries operated on

subsistence subsistence levels right and

maybe double the subsistence level but

not much more than that it's through

industrialization through modern

capitalism that real wealth becomes

possible real abundance right and that

shows in that graph i mean that graph

tells the economic history and in doing

so the history of our

world

it shows the great diversions from the

19th century until today now recently

there has been a slight

move downwards in terms of the

proportion of between country inequality

within global inequality right and why

is that

as i said because china got richer right

lifting millions out of poverty

um making a country of more than a

billion people grow

that means a reduction in global

inequality

by definition now the question is to

what extent the story will

go

on if

all late developers of course catch up

with the rich countries that would mean

we would revert back to a world where

class was more important than location

right where basically inequality between

countries

isn't as important as the inequality

within

countries right and milanovich calls

that from marx to funeral and back right

remember marx or ricardo or other

economists they talked about the

capitalists and the workers and to some

extent the land owners right as the

people who you know make up the economy

and who divide the

goods

the richness the wealth in the economy

right fano takes this um

you know contradiction between capital

and worker replaces it with the

contradiction between

the dichotomy sorry between

colonizer and the colonize right so

fanon you know he's marks in the sense

that he sees a fundamental struggle

moving history forward but it's not a

class struggle it's the struggle between

the colonized and the colonizer and in

terms of global inequality that was

certainly true i mean look at this graph

inequality

rises the most in the 20th century and

it peaks in the 50s

60s right this is when inequality

between countries

was highest and that is epitomized that

is shown in the contradiction in the

struggle between the colonizer and the

colonists right where the colonizer has

everything all the power and the

colonized have none of the power right

and the idea of the law of course is to

expulse

the

the colonizer and turn this

um you know

dissolve that that contradiction so to

say okay but we still live in a more

fanonian

than marxian world in that sense right

because inequality between countries

exceeds that of within countries when we

look at the

no global number of or the global issue

of inequality right so these are some

interesting calculations now look at

this little graph here it shows you gdp

per capita in the us china and india

from the 19th century until recently and

here you know you can see the story of

divergence and convergence right in the

19th century the us takes off and grows

china india remains segment but

have you know risen recently

in the economic sense so the question is

to what extent would this story of

convergence go on if the two most

populous countries in the world

successfully catch up then of course we

see a move away in terms of overall

numbers from the fanonian maybe back to

a more 19th century kind of

marx

marx you know riccardian

model of the world

okay what does all of this have to do

with migration well it's simple

basically it means that

the more inequality there is the higher

the incentive for migration

is right

and that's just a basic fact if you see

better opportunity elsewhere you move

especially if your country remains stuck

if your country remains

poor and this is of course the case for

you know

large number of countries in the middle

east and a large number of countries in

sub-saharan africa too because it's

these countries that make up or that

sends

involuntarily essentially the highest

number

of migrants to

europe so how does europe treat how does

europe react to that

kind of

influx

take a look at this map which i took

from

the international organization

for migration

and this map tracks the number of

migrant deaths in the world

and you can see

that well first of all the mediterranean

is the biggest death trap for migrants

but of course

migrants are being deterred pushed away

elsewhere too between the us and mexico

many parts of asia the malacca straits

for example between

indonesia and malaysia

and

others but i want to focus on the

mediterranean

so according to

the international organization

for migration

since

2014

about 47 737

migrants have died trying to get into

uh whatever promised land they wanted to

get into

this

the actual number is certainly

much higher

out of these roughly 47

48 000

um

24 000 migrants have died trying to

cross the mediterranean since 2014 again

this number is or must be an under

representation the actual number will be

higher because only engaged citizens

have an interest in counting the debt

right

i mean europe wants to ignore the topic

obviously because it destroys or at

least say let's say it contradicts the

self-image of an enlightened and

enlightened and human rights abiding

west right

those states where those migrants come

from in the middle east in sub-saharan

africa they also prefer not to know why

because every migrant from tunisia from

eritrea is an indictment of the

developmental failure of the states

where they're coming from right every

migrant that dies in the mediterranean

shows the failure of a state to provide

for jobs and to provide for a normal

decent life right these are stories of

state failures of states unable to

protect their citizens

especially since the syrian refugee

crisis the european response to

migration has become militarized and the

name for that is frontex which is the

european

border guard agency a militarized agency

that you know engages in you know

heavy deterrence

of

migrants

so the euro the european response to

migration overall is marked by discord

among eu members um a good measure of

incompetence

by politicians and institutions and a

general disregard

for the topic

and also marked by the search of the far

right which has pushed

to the center

this idea of a militarized response to

migration the idea of migration as a

threat rather than an opportunity
