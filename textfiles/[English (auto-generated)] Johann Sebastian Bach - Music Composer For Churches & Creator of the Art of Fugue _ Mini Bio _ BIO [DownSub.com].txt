b√∂ck is a musical giant and his ideas

and his skill almost primarily still

leave us all in awe Johann Sebastian

Bach was born in eisenach Germany on

March 21st 1685 raised in a family of

musicians Bach learned to play the

harpsichord organ and violin baa came

from generations of musicians the term

Bach at the time that Johann Sebastian

Bach lived was almost synonymous with

being a musician as a young boy Bach was

given a religious education which would

deeply affect his life Bach was

profoundly religious and he saw

everything that he did as a composer and

musician as basically an act of prayer

after landing his first job as a court

musician in 1703 Bach worked in various

positions as an organist allowing him to

compose Church cantatas Bach created

vast numbers of works for keyboard and

probably the best-known of those works

is the Toccata and Fugue in d-minor

and i think one of the reasons why this

has risen to such great popularity was

of course due to its orchestration and

Walt Disney's Fantasia from 1717 to 1723

Bach composed a number of works

including the widely regarded

Brandenburg Concertos and the solo

keyboard compositions the well-tempered

clavier the Brandenburg Concertos have

to be the most popular works of Bach

judging from the number of recordings

there of them that there are and there

are numerous occasions in which all six

are performed on the same concert in

1723 Bach was given a new position where

he could both teach students and create

an astounding collection of church music

Bach was appointed Cantor or director of

music for the four main churches in

Leipzig Germany the cantatas that he

created for this purpose contained some

of his greatest music

17:33 bock composed mass in B minor

which gained him a position as royal

court composer to the king of Poland ba

added to the mass one section at a time

mostly by utilizing older Lutheran

cantatas and adapting them for the mass

and it of course lasts as one of Bach's

greatest contributions to sacred music

thought created a new composition called

the art of fugue in 1749 but on July

28th of that year he died after

suffering a stroke Bach is considered to

be the composer who knew how to put

notes together better than any other

single composer Bach has a kind of

popularity be outside of professional

musicians and the fact that there are

nearly 40 Bach Festival in this country

I think it is testimony to that
