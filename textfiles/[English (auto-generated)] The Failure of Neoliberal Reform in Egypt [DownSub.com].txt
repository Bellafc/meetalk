let's move to our case study which is

egypt and what i want to do here is to

look at egypt in historical perspective

and see how

developmentalism

turned into neoliberalism and how that

history

produced a combination of old

authoritarianism with a lack of private

sector

growth which is sort of the worst

combination so how did that come about

if you look at egypt you can see how

complex these stories actually

uh are right so as a piece play a

role so a structural adjustment plays a

role in the

reduced growth of developing countries

but it's a you know complex historical

and political

story

let's look at it

so here we have gamal abdel nasser who

from 1952 effectively onwards was the

egyptian

president until his

death he was not democratically elected

and did not rule democratically he came

to power in a military

coup

in the fashion of a lot of countries in

the world during that time

and ruled

you know an authoritarian fashion but he

was very popular right so he was a

popular

leader

you know for for many egyptians

and was one of the big figures of the

non-aligned movement and the non-aligned

world

so what did nasa want and what did he

stand for

he

he stood for redistribution

he stood for national sovereignty for

nationalism he stood for

anti-colonialism anti-imperialism

which you know had

turned into or you know sort of

went hand in hand in a way with being

very critical

of the west

and this also translated into

an economic policy that is

developmentalist where the state takes

up

a massive role in the economy

so nazarism provides a great case study

one of many in fact for the task of

autonomous development hindered by a the

problem of late development or catch-up

development and b the structure of the

cold war aka the politics of

the time nazarism led to a massive

expansion of the state at the highest

point the state controlled up to 90

percent of the

economy right so this is you know the

almost we're almost in

command economy territory here

um

nasarism relies for its popularity on

popular redistribution

measures

one big one is land reform right we've

talked about land reform

previously and what nasa did he was to

break the

political power

of the land owning

classes

so there was large-scale

expropriation and i mentioned how

nasa is extremely popular across egypt i

have one friend in egypt who comes from

you know rather

rich family and his family actually was

expropriated

by nasa so i i met one of the few

families who didn't like him then of

course actually i'm you know not being

very truthful here um if your muslim

brother like it is you also do not like

nasa because he was very repressive of

the muslim

brotherhood anyhow

so this is nasa efforts in

industrialization certainly the state

sector provides a majority of jobs and

that's of course a problem if the state

provides jobs then the state

relies on handing out these jobs to

well you know stay illegitimate estate

and for that it needs money right and

where does that money come from if you

don't sell enough stuff whether it's raw

materials or industrial goods the money

comes from

loans and as other countries

uh

in the postgraduate world at the time

egypt racked up quite a bit of debt 2

billion dollars of debt by 1965

out of which

more than 70

76 roughly is owed to western

governments and banks

what happens is that the conflict with

israel and the 1967 war led to a crisis

in relations with the west and nasa

becomes very reliant on the soviet block

after and this is the the fate of

smaller countries in a cold war which we

could observe back then which you're

able to observe right now as well in

fact which is that they have to choose

one or the other it's very hard to

remain independent if you need

money right so nasa even though he's not

a

communist in the soviet type of sense

he's not a communist

he's an arab socialist that's what he

calls himself

he becomes reliant on the soviet bloc

for military supplies and development

loans

nasa's successor then anwar sadat makes

a choice he bets on the winning side

in the cold war and he bets on the west

so he kicks out these soviet military

advisors he makes peace with israel

after

the 1917

1973 war

with it and it aligns with the west so

now it gets grants and loans from not

only the us-aligned oil monarchies but

also the imf and the world bank and the

1980s are a typical period of structural

adjustments

here in the history of egypt what does

structural adjustment

do well as always it first cuts

subsidies right so we've seen how in the

nucerous state

the state

create legitimacy by providing jobs and

by giving handouts right those handouts

are getting slashed those jobs are

getting slashed

but

and so i said 80s actually 97 and

already by 1977 and we see massive

popular unrest against the imf and the

world bank

in egypt especially against the cutting

of food

subsidies right the so-called bread rice

which break out in egypt in 1977

and so that cannot afford to pay the

political price for the tough

cure of adjustments he can't

you know

adjusting to the demands of the mf would

have cost him his position the trouble

is that the us needed sadat at the time

but still needs egypt and that's why

authority becomes

less harsh in egypt right it is allowed

to keep certain subsidies in place which

also tells you know that the whole story

is a political

story

so that is kept in power

egypt's debt peaks at the beginning of

the 80s and is then restructured over

the decades towards longer term lower

interest loans so egypt gets a better

loan package the price that it pays for

that is political alignment with the

west so that's the concession or if you

want the benefit depending on

perspective egypt becomes an ally of the

west in the middle east which does not

reflect the mood on the

arab street quote unquote or you know

with an egyptian society more in general

but that's the the story here slightly

ease and

adjustment

because of political alignment but still

harsh adjustment that leads to

wide spread revolt

what does egypt look like after

adjustment you know basically the

economy that led up to the 2011 revolves

in the country

what structure adjustment did was

certainly to reduce the role of the

massive state in the economy right

and you could argue that this was sort

of overdue right but here's what not

happened and this is quite typical for a

lot of other countries as well the

state's role is reduced but the role of

the private sector doesn't go up so the

state goes down but the private sector

doesn't

go up in other words you do not get a

nice kind of industry and technology

innovation based capitalist economy in

egypt but instead what you get is a

state that to a large extent is a

anti-rentier state a state which derives

a lot of its income

from rent and not on the stuff that it

produces

so what are either's main sources of

income there's tourism

first of all there's

limited oil and gas exports there is the

tolls from the sewers

canal and there's remittances by

egyptians working

abroad so there's a rentee orientation

to the digital state and a dependency on

imports that's the economy of egypt

right which saps did not change but

actually just entrench

the neo-patrimonial state is how we can

call the political structure of egypt

there are the trappings of democracy but

really the state belongs to

the military

to the mubarak

clan before and now to

sisi but the state is owned by the

military and capitalism in egypt is

politically determined what you get out

of it is determined by how close you are

to the state

so the whole outcome of this process

is state capitalism

but without a developmental

purpose right

you get the enrichment of a small

business elite that is connected to the

state

um but this is very very different to

the image of the

max weber type of state where

the

state is a legal rational

type

actor

and

sort of serves a bourgeois class society

instead it's you know rather corrupt and

the small business elites attached to

the state makes most of the money that

is derived from rents tourism or big

mega construction projects but what you

don't get is the sort of

thorough and technologically competitive

industrialization that you see in east

asia right

so structural adjustment and neoliberal

reforms were not helpful to create a

quote-unquote western idealized state

and economy but the reasons for that are

complicated and relate to egypt's state

structure its developmental history and

the role of the geostrategically

important middle east during the cold

war

and

after all right so this is a short

discussion of the case of egypt of

course the case of say chile argentina

or

mozambique would look different right

maybe this is something that you can

look at for your
