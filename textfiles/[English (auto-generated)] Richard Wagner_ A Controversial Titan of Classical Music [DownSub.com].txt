more on them in a bit

even if you're not a lover of classical

music you may have felt that first

rush of adrenaline at the top of ride of

the vowel killeries or shed a tear

or two at the first swell of here comes

the bride

these are two among many of the famed

compositions of

today's protagonist one of the titans of

music of all ages

and all genres richard wagner he's a man

who left a mark

not only on music but on philosophy

society

and politics of the 19th and 20th

centuries today we will explore his

personal life

his main works his controversial views

finally we will address the ultimate

question of his legacy which tied his

music to the propaganda efforts of the

third reich but does he really deserve

to be remembered as the soundtrack to

an authoritarian war-mongering regime

well i hope you're sitting comfortably

as today's video

is suitably wagnerian in length

wilhelm richard wagner was born on may

22

1813 in leipzig then part of saxony

presently in modern-day germany the city

is remembered for its contribution

to arts literature and music composers

like johann sebastian bach wolfgang

amadeus mozart and

felix mendelssohn all worked as

organists in the church

of saint thomas the same church where

young richard was baptized so

not a bad start for a future giant of

music

baby rickard would barely get to meet

his father carl friedrich wagner a

police clerk

died in november of 1813 during a

typhoid epidemic a year later rickard's

mother

joanna remarried this time taking vows

with noted actor painter and poet

ludwig meyer she worked with him in

dresden taking

richard and his eight siblings along

there is evidence that johanna and

ludwig had been lovers for a long time

and that the artist

may have actually been richard's

biological father whatever the truth

gaia had a strong bond with rehard and

encouraged him to develop his creative

and artistic side unfortunately the boy

soon

lost his second father figure 2 ludwig

died suddenly on november

30 1821 but the wagners stayed in

dresden for

several more years during which time

rickard started taking piano lessons he

gravitated

more towards literature in his early

teens he penned his first work a

five-act tragedy called

leobold and adelaide it was only after a

move back to leipzig in 1827 that young

wagner

started taking music more seriously

during the second leipzig tour he began

taking lessons in harmony

and counterpoint he also started

attending performances from

his favorite genre opera richard

composed his first serious sonatas and

string quartets in the late 1820s

encouraged by his natural ability his

mother joanna

convinced him to enroll at leipzig

university to study musical composition

the young composer flourished his

piano sonata in b-flat major impressed

one of his teachers so much

that he agreed to give him extra lessons

for free

at this stage rickard's compositions

were small in scale if our

musically inclined friends will allow me

the term

what i mean is that he focused on

writing string quartets or sonata's

compositions for

a single instrument but in the 1830s

wagner began composing

orchestral symphonies and even

incidental music for a play

king enzio this marked his debut in

writing for a theatrical production

as he began collecting his first

favorable reviews rickard decided it was

time to compose a work in his favorite

genre

opera his inaugural work was dihoxite or

the wedding but it remained incomplete

you'd be forgiven for thinking this was

an early sign of writers or

well composer's block but wagner quickly

bounced back with new finished works

between 1833 and 1836 he composed

his first two complete operas the first

one was titled the fairies

in contrast to common practice at the

time wagner wrote both

the music and the libretto or the text

it told the story of the love between a

fairy princess and a human opposed by

the fairy's father but unfortunately it

was never performed during wagner's

lifetime

his second goal was the ban on love a

comic opera based on william

shakespeare's measure for measure this

time

wagner's work earned a stage production

which promptly flopped

after one performance so if you ever

despair about

finding success in this life remember

this even

wagner totally flunked his first three

operas

but even these disappointments provided

a great opportunity for wagner

to test and develop his musical and

philosophical ideas while writing the

fairies and its floppy follow-up

wagner had become friends with heinrich

lauber

a key figure of the young german's

literary movement inspired by their

ideals wagner started to reject the

values of romantic poetry and music that

were

typical of the early 19th century

instead he began developing a new

personal vision imbued with

pan-germanism and

progressive liberal political thinking

derived from the early ideals of the

french revolution

these were political and philosophical

sentiments which

wagner shared with many more young

european intellectuals who were

disappointed by the restoration at the

time richard had

started courting actress christine

wilhelmine planner

known as mina together they moved to

magdeburg

and started working with the besman

theatrical company it was with this

troupe that

wagner had conducted the premiere of his

second completed opera

the ban of love in march 1836. the total

fiasco that

ensued bankrupted bethmann's company and

left wagner with

few professional prospects luckily mina

was

a planner not only in name she sorted

out their next move which was a

relocation to koenigsberg

now modern-day kalingrad on the baltic

sea here she took a new job at the

city's main theatre

and the two lovers married on the 24th

of november

very soon after the arrival of the

wagner's the kanesberg

theatre found itself on a slippery slope

towards bankruptcy

rickard was also plagued by other

troubles mina not exactly the faithful

sort of wife had eloped with a young

lover help swiftly came from heinrich

dawn

conductor richard knew from his leipzig

days dawn secured a post as conductor

for wagner at the german theater in riga

in modern-day latvia this job would give

him financial security

and maybe even the chance to mend his

relationship with mina the plan worked

well sort of wagner arrived in riga in

august of 1837 and by

early 1838 mina was again by his side

the two enjoyed a better quality of

life for a short time but more problems

were not

far behind as the couple lived beyond

their means debts started to accumulate

at the same time mina had resumed her

infidelities accepting the courtship of

the theater's very director in other

words his wife had

started dating his boss wagner was also

frustrated by the poor quality of the

frivolous comedic operas he was forced

to conduct

eventually also this experience proved

to be a disappointment

in 1838 the german theatre did not renew

his contract with debt collectors

literally pounding on his door

on july the 10th rickard dragged mina to

the harbor and the two escaped on a

smuggler's ship

amidst a formidable sea storm their

destination

well that would be paris as the ship

navigates the waves

and winds let's ponder this man's life

so far

for a 26 year old he had achieved some

solid success but

also some catastrophic failure

professionally

and personally and yet in his luggage he

carried a wealth of experience

that he would later put to good use

while in riga exasperated by the light

nature of musical theater

he had started writing the libretto for

a new work

this would become the monumental opera

rienzi based on a novel by edward bulwer

litton this

is a historical piece about a 14th

century roman leader and his populist

uprising

during his tenure at the german theatre

wagner also developed a new conducting

stance revolutionary in those times

rather than waving the baton while

facing the audience he

faced the orchestra to establish a

closer connection with the musicians

finally he took careful notes about the

architecture of the german theatre he

especially

admired the dark auditorium the simple

deck or the amphitheater layout

the deep orchestral pit these features

would all

later inspire the construction of his

own theater but

let's not get ahead of ourselves the

wagners landed in france in september

1839 after a tortuous journey during

which mina had suffered a miscarriage

this was a tragic event which marked the

beginning of another unfortunate period

of marital conflict

in paris mina was able to tread the

boards now

and again rickard while the only wooden

boards he saw were those of the doors

slammed on his face apparently parisians

had little interest in his music

wagner took a day job completing

arrangements for a music publisher while

he

hustled to get rienzie on stage an old

friend from leipzig composer giacomo

mayabeer

interceded on wagner's behalf with the

director of the paris opera

unfortunately the parisian establishment

was too conservative to accept the work

of a

young unknown german composer undeterred

wagner continued to write and compose

completing his next opera the flying

dutchman

this opera was inspired in part by a

legendary ghost ship

as well as the wagner's own perilous

voyage from riga

musically it introduced for the first

time one of wagner's signature

techniques

the light motif a recurring musical

theme associated with a specific

character or situation

the light motif concept has had a major

lasting effect on modern

and contemporary music even on film and

tv soundtracks consider the

imperial march from star wars or the

reigns of castamere from game of thrones

two ominous accompaniments that

sonically acknowledge the presence of

series villains

but back to the 1800s while wagner was

composing the flying dutchman

he had the idea to hustle back home he

sent a petition to the king of saxony

friedrich augustus ii

asking him to accept rienzi as a

production

at the dresden court theatre in june of

1841 the king accepted

more than a year later on july the 7th

1842 richard and mina

left paris to prepare the premiere of

reinze

considering wagner's track record his

relative obscurity and

the fact that the opera was five hours

long well

you can probably guess how it went and

you would be wrong the opera debuted on

october 20th 1842 and audiences

absolutely loved it all five hours

the year 1843 took off with another

rapturous debut

that of the flying dutchman a piece in

which the composer further pushed the

boundaries of operatic convention

these successors granted wagner a new

role as musical director

of the royal court in dresden with

newfound financial stability the young

composer could finally repay

his many debts well kind of he actually

just ended up borrowing more money to

pay them but i mean who are we to judge

you see he had some other concerns to

keep him occupied this was europe in the

mid-1840s and another age of political

and philosophical debate was brewing

after the post-napoleonic restoration

a fuse had been lit under the continent

and a spark was gradually burning its

way towards

1848 that bomb of a revolutionary year

the detonation was inevitable and the

young restless wagner

had already picked his side while

working for the king of saxony wagner

continued honing his operatic craft

the next of his operas to premiere was

tanhauser in october of 1845.

this work deals with the titular

wandering minstrel torn between pagan

beliefs and christianity

between the pleasures of worldly passion

and spiritual love

while developing the libretto for this

opera wagner began studying the

mythology of german and nordic law

which he found to be a gold mine of

inspiration his favorite writer became

medieval poet wolfram von erschenbach

whose works are used as a basis for two

future operas

parsifal and lohengrin lowengrin

revolves around a mysterious knight who

protects young elsa against a malicious

ruler count

telraman wagner completed it in april

1848

just when revolutionaries across europe

were rising up against their own

malicious rulers wagner frequented the

dresden court while

writing these new operas but he

preferred to mingle with revolutionary

activists who

shared his progressive ideals his desire

for

a constitutional government or even his

yearning for a united germany

most notable amongst them was augustus

rachel the

editor of the radical newspaper

volksblatter and

mikhail berkunen the founder of

collectivist anarchism

initially saxony was not involved in the

revolutionary wildfire of 1848

but after more than a year of quiet

descent in may of 1849 dresden revolted

against its king

the saxon people took to the streets

pressing the king to institute

social and electoral reforms wagner was

on their side

he wrote articles against the

aristocracy and in favor of a republican

constitution

and he personally distributed

revolutionary manifestos to the saxon

troops

eventually he got involved with some of

the more serious action

and on may 7 1849 richard wagner

volunteered to spy on troop movements

from

the top of a church tower in dresden

soon he spotted incoming troops

the problem was that they spotted him

too and they opened fire

luckily for the future of music history

those unnamed soldiers were bad shots

and wagner escaped in one piece

but his name had already been

compromised by his rebellious articles

when the uprising eventually failed

saxon authorities issued an arrest

warrant

on may the 16th but the composer was on

a streak of good luck

the warrens bore a very vague

description of wagner 37 to 38 years old

of medium height with brown hair and

eyeglasses

they might as well have written a guy

somewhere in europe

the incompetence of saxon police allowed

wagner to escape dresden and relocate to

zurich switzerland with the help of his

friend

composer franz list wagner spent the

next 12 years in exile from germany

running low on morale and even lower on

funds

a group of friends thankfully arranged

for him to receive a regular pension to

give him some stability

except he sabotaged himself by having an

affair with one of the wife of said

friends

so much for gratitude wagner during the

first years in switzerland the wagners

were

again unhappy mina slipped into

depression while rickard

suffered from composer's block if there

is such a thing

he did write some essays though the

first one the artwork of the future was

a visionary work in which he described

opera as a total work of art which

combined music song dance poetry visual

arts and stagecraft

the follow-up published in 1850 was his

infamous judaism

in music essay in this work he expressed

publicly

for the first time his anti-semitic

views which he held in private

throughout his life even extending his

racial disdain of other nations his

thesis was that jews had no connection

to the lofty german national spirit and

as such they were

capable of producing only shallow and

artificial music

according to wagner jewish composers

were only seeking popularity and

financial success incapable

of conceiving genuine art the jewish

artist could only

speak in imitation of others make art

and imitation of others

he cannot really speak write or create

art on his own

it can be argued that wagner did have

many jewish friends and that

anti-semitic views were quite common in

europe at the time

however taking the time to write edinton

published such

views really took the arbitrary hatred

of a whole portion of mankind to

well another level and yet wagner's

musical genius

it can't be denied nor can his drive for

innovation

in the musical medium while he was

working on his first pamphlets the

composer had also started working on his

best known masterpiece

the four opera cycle the ring of

naibalung

or simply the ring this cycle includes

the rheingold the valkyrie

siegfried and twilight of the gods the

plot is inspired by nordic mythology and

revolves around a magic ring that can

bestow the power to rule the world

the god wooten steals the ring from its

maker

the nibelong dwarf alberich he then

hands it over to giants fafner and

farsol

as payment for them building valhalla

wotan's mortal grandson

the hero siegfried slays fafner to

retrieve the ring only to be killed by

alberic's son

the valkyrie brunhild secret's lover

returns the ring to the rhine maidens

rightful owners of the gold from which

the ring had been forged

she then commits suicide on sigrid's

funeral pyre before the gods and

valhalla are all destroyed in the

twilight of the gods

if you want any more details on the

story you are welcome to attend the full

15-hour performance according to carol

berger professor of music at stanford

university the ring is an allegory for

wagner's political beliefs inspired by

his revolutionary experience

siegfried's quest represents a struggle

to wrestle power from the hands of

capitalists that's the

goldsmithing dwarves as well as the

aristocracy

the gods in his lifetime though wagner

did not

expound on the meaning of the cycle but

rather on his musical vision

in an 1851 publication a communication

to my friends

wagner described his work as dramas

rather than operas they would be

performed at a specially designed

festival over the course of four

consecutive days

allowing audiences to enjoy the cycle in

its entirety the composition of the ring

cycle absorbed most of wagner's energies

during much of the 1850s by june of 1857

the composer had written and composed

the first two dramas and

the first two acts of siegfried before

setting them aside for

another project tristan und isolde now

of your first purchase of a website or a

domain let's get back to it

the plot of tristan and isolde borrows

from the legends of king arthur and is

inspired by the philosophy

of another arthur schopenhauer wagner

had first read schopenhauer's works in

1854

and had become an easy convert to his

philosophy a deeply pessimistic view

of the human condition subject to the

whims of blind impulsive will this is

reflected in the story

of the two titular characters their love

story is subject to irrational

destructive passion which can

only end in death schopenhauer's basis

also influenced the balance of drama

versus music

wagner had earlier theorized that the

plot dialogue and poetic aspect of an

opera should be preeminent with

music in a subservient role schopenhauer

suggested that

instead music was now the leading

passionate almost

irrational force whose tenor and tone

drove the message to the audience

another source of inspiration for

tristan undissolder came from

wagner's own infatuation with a married

lady poet

mathilde wessendock again this lady was

the wife of one of wagner's patrons and

benefactors

it must have been a heartfelt affair but

again what i am learning here is that do

not lend money to rio hard wagner

for he certainly knows how to repay you

the affair collapsed in 1858 when mina

intercepted a letter to matilda from

rickard

from then on the couple was virtually

separated mina returned to germany while

rickard spent time in venice from where

he continued his correspondence with

matilda

mina and richard tried to reconcile some

years later in paris

wagner had moved there again to organize

a new production of tanharsa in 1861.

this was a fiasco as opponent of emperor

napoleon iii

took the occasion to stage protests

against his foreign policy beliefs the

reunion with mina was similarly a

debacle and the two parted ways once

more

in the meantime things were improving

back home in dresden thanks to his

friend fran's list

productions of lohan grin and other

works by wagner had become all the rage

and saxony

his artistic success had pressured the

government to issue a full pardon for

the revolutionary composer

the king of saxony waited with open arms

but wagner had since

set his sights on the patronage of

another monarch king ludwig of bavaria

while still a fifteen-year-old prince

ludwig had attended a performance of

leongren a rapturous experience which

had left him in tears known to be

eccentric flamboyant and even mad ludwig

built a sort of private psychological

fantasy around wagner's imaginary world

a retreat in which to escape from the

pressures of court life

this can be seen in the fairy tale

castles he built such as the

astonishing neuschwanstein or the

whimsical lindehoff palace which

came equipped with a golden swan boat

directly inspired by lohangren

naturally when ludwig was crowned king

of bavaria at the age of 18 one of his

first acts was to summon wagner to his

court by may of 1864 rickard had parted

ways once and for all with mina although

he still supported her financially

burying himself into more and more debt

sensing an opportunity he eagerly

accepted the invitation

at their meeting the king

enthusiastically offered to fund any

opera the maestro wished to stage and

wagner chose tristan and isolde he had

previously tried to produce it in vienna

but the show had never premiered as it

was deemed too difficult to perform and

too expensive to stage

but the king's coffers were deep so on

june the 10th 1865

the drama premiered in munich the

conductor for this run was hans von

bulow hans and his young wife kazima had

welcomed to the world their baby

daughter also named isolde just

a couple of months earlier well not

exactly their daughter

the biological father was well you

guessed it mr richard luz panzerwagner

kazima was herself the illegitimate

daughter of

franz liszt who disapproved of her

affair with his friend wagner

this is just another proof of our

theorem if you do wagner a failure he

will do your wife

or daughter or maybe both the affair or

rather the scandal

came the talk of munich at the same time

jealous courtiers were

wary of the influence that wagner had

over the king and started pressuring

ludwig to get rid of him

in december 1865 ludwig was finally

forced to ask the composer to leave

munich

the king even considered abdicating to

follow his hero into exile but wagner

convinced him to remain on the throne

during a second swiss exile wagner took

time to revise and expand his pamphlet

judaism and music

publishing the new version in 1869. this

time it received wider circulation and

reaction than the previous edition

even causing mass protests at the

performances of his new work the master

singers of nuremberg

in the meantime he had been living in

sin with kasima

siring two children eva and siegfried

the two eventually married in august of

1870 after mina died of a heart attack

and

kasima had obtained a divorce during the

early 1870s rickard and kasima developed

a friendship with

a young and brilliant philosopher one

who had become professor of classical

philosophy at the age of 24. his name

was friedrich nietzsche

a name forever associated with that of

the composer

a competent amateur peerist nietzsche

had admired wagner's music and ideals

since his student days

while teaching at the university of

basil nietzsche had taken the habit of

frequently visiting the wagners who

lived in nearby luzon the young

philosopher became

a staunch admirer of the older composer

which he considered a father figure he

also had potentially developed a small

crush for kasima which

may have justified the frequent visits

in his 1872 book the birth of tragedy

friedrich

openly expressed his admiration for

wagner in this work he argued that greek

tragedy emerged from

the dark and irrational spirit of music

partially tamed by

principles of order over time these

elements had become imbalanced with a

preponderance of rationalism

over the sheer creative impulse of music

nature believed that the victory of

socratic rationalism was

plaguing contemporary art but that

rickard wagner could

restore the old balance with his

impulsive and passionate music

having suffered through exiles and

revolutions wagner now had a

settled stable domestic life with a

faithful wife and a devoted younger

friend a rising star in academia

he could now direct his energies towards

completing his masterpiece

the ring cycle

[Music]

the monumental ring cycle needed a

properly monumental opera house and

wagner identified the wright theater

this was the margravia opera house in

beirut upper fransonia

by now part of the unified second german

reich wagner hated the decor of the

place finding it too lavish and

intricate for his taste but he loved the

massive 27 meter stage

as the composer was finishing his work

on the librettos and the scores he began

to rethink his decision on

the venue for his magnum opus rather

than composing with

the margravial theater he would build a

whole new venue that could provide

every detail that he wanted the design

borrowed many ideas from the german

theater in riga where

he had worked as a young conductor the

main feature would be the orchestra pit

deep enough to

hide the musicians from view allowing

audiences to focus entirely on the

performance

this setup would allow for music to

filter from under the stage fill the

wooden structure of the theater

and surround the public with sound such

a project required

massive funds which wagner raised by

touring tirelessly and by borrowing more

money from his old friend

ludwig bavaria the new theater the first

spielhouse was completed in time for the

premiere of

the ring of the neighbourlongs from

august the 13th

through the 17th 1876. the rehearsals

were not a piece of cake the score was

hellishly difficult unlike anything else

the

tenors and sopranos had experienced so

far wagner himself did not make things

easier micromanaging every aspect of the

production despite his best efforts some

serious cock-ups did take place though a

scene in siegfried

required the presence of a massive

animated dragon the beast was crafted in

london and shipped in pieces to beirut

but the neck the most important

component

ended up in beirut but the show did go

on the audience of the premier included

ludwig of bavaria kaiser wilhelm and

emperor dom pedro ii of brazil the south

american monarch checked in at a local

hotel signing himself

in simply as pedro occupation

emperor another sort of royalty

intellectual royalty attended in droves

tchaikovsky liszt tolstoy nietzsche they

all

had a seat in this theater by this time

the relationship between the composer

and the devoted philosopher had

considerably cooled

ideologically speaking nietzsche did not

approve of wagner's persistent

anti-semitism

nor his latest pet hatred a dislike of

french culture at the same time

friedrich had come to re-evaluate his

early disdain of rationalism

gravitating towards the materialistic

and scientific ideas of his new friend

paul hrey who happened to be french and

jewish on a personal level nietzsche

become weary of wagner's overbearing

egoism and

disregard for the feelings of those

around him case in point at the premiere

of the ring

wagner had his 24 year old mistress

judith gourtier

sitting next to him in full view of poor

kasima

nietzsche's 1876 paper richard wagner at

beirut was

critical of the composer as an

individual however the philosopher

continued to recognize the merits of

wagner's work

it wasn't just nietzsche who was piling

on the praise the ring was met with wild

applause lauded by audiences and critics

alike

many praised the structural innovations

employed by wagner in his theater too

for example he had asked for the

auditorium to be left in the dark during

performances this

is commonplace now but back then it was

a revolutionary decision

lights were always left on during shows

to allow spectators to mingle or get a

refreshment

wagner's innovation instead demanded

that audiences stay put

and absorb a continuous flow of musical

drama without interruption

this was another wagnerian innovation

before him operas were structured as

a series of areas duets or other set

pieces connected by reichitativo

sections of

sparsely scored dialogue the masters

operas were conceived instead as

single massive continuing compositions

after the triumph of the beiruth

festival

wagner began work on his latest opera

parciful which

took him four years to complete this was

a mystical near religious experience to

him reflected in the abundant christian

imagery present in this drama

eventually he saw the performance of

parceval as a sort of sacred rite which

could be performed only in its own

dedicated cathedral

the theatre at beirut wagner finished

the score in january 1882 and parcerfall

was performed 16 times during july and

august of that year

becoming known as the second beiruth

festival the conductor for the whole run

hermann was the best german he could

offer and he knew the score inside out

wagner only had a minor [ __ ] with him

his surname

was levi and he was jewish apparently

the brilliant albeit bigoted composer

could not stand the idea of a

non-christian musician being associated

with his sacred work

wagner pestered levi for months trying

to get him baptized

eventually wagner accepted this jewish

musician would do

an outstanding job after all and the

parcel was an incredible success

elated but exhausted by the whole

experience wagner and kasima retreated

to venice the couple despite being

generally happy had been

experiencing some tensions lately and

needed some time to themselves the

source of those tensions came from

mccart himself going through a full-on

midlife crisis kasima recently found out

that

after judith he had been having an

affair with a young english soprano

carrie pringle it seems that once

richard popped he

just couldn't stop proximity to young

lovers did not make richard younger nor

healthier

already struggling with a heart

condition at 2pm on february

13 1883 richard wagner let out a cry of

pain

while resting in his venetian villa he

died within the hour as casima played

the piano for him

a funerary gondola carried the maestro

for a procession over the grand canal

his body was buried in beirut

not far from his cathedral of music

[Music]

in modern times rickard wagner's legacy

is frequently associated even at the

superficial level

with the third reich in nazi politics

it's easy to

trace a straight line connecting

wagner's anti-semitism

francophobia german nationalism

mysticism

and monumental enthralling music with

the ideology and propaganda of hitler's

regime

but is this association really

inevitable for sure adolf hitler loved

wagner's operas in mind camphi even

quotes lothagrin and

how much it impressed him hitler became

chancellor of germany almost exactly 50

years after wagner's death

he took the occasion to organize lavish

commemorations at beirut and to forge

friendships with

wagner's descendants in later years and

with the support of propaganda minister

joseph goebbels

hitler and the nazi party effectively

appropriated some wagnerian music and

iconography

into their propaganda efforts but this

does not mean that ricard wagner and the

nazi party were

exactly on the same wavelength one of

the party's favorites was the ring cycle

and its protagonist siegfried was

interpreted as a fine specimen of german

fighting manhood but as we've heard

wagner's idea was for sea creed to be

more of a subverter

of established order fighting against

powerful elites

it should be said that as a minister

goebbels liked to pick and choose which

of wagner's works

suited his goals for example he decided

to ban

parciful in 1939 because it prompted

pacifism spirituality and

brotherly love among men which is not

exactly the best message if you want to

motivate your troops

to go and invade poland and well that's
