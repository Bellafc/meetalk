I think probably the words of Goethe

described it best and I'll paraphrase a

phenomenon like Mozart is something that

can't be explained Wolfgang Amadeus

Mozart was born on January 27 1756 in

Salzburg Austria as a three-year-old

Mozart learned the piano by watching his

father Leopold teach his older sister

Maria Anna this child prodigy who was

writing music by the age of six began

very quickly to develop his skills in

all of the different musical forms and

he mastered them all starting at the age

of six until seventeen Mozart traveled

and performed across Europe with his

sister Mozart made a living as a concert

pianist and so he wrote many of his

concertos for piano for himself to bring

along on tour he'd write a symphony for

this gig he's got next Thursday and

sometimes it was that quick by 17 Mozart

was appointed assistant concert master

for the Royal Court of Salzburg where he

expanded his range of musical works one

of the remarkable things about Mozart is

the fact that he succeeded in so many

different musical genres including opera

symphony chamber music Sonata even

musical comedy Mozart worked constantly

and at a lightning pace Mozart married

in 1782 and lived lavishly off his

success almost to the brink of ruin to

earn money he continued to be a prolific

composer and performer and in 1786

Mozart successfully premiered his opera

The Marriage of Figaro Mozart's really

the one who brought opera to a more

personal and great level such that these

works have never disappeared

but Mozart's opulent lifestyle coupled

with the Austria Turkish war caused

major financial problems propelling

Mozart into a deep depression

he was later in life turning more inward

and looking at things more reflectively

and perhaps more seriously even the

Magic Flute for example had spiritual

overtones that were unusual both for

Mozart and for opera in general at the

time in the final year before his death

Mozart made a personal recovery and

composed some of his most famous works

including the Magic Flute and the final

piano concerto in b-flat Mozart wrote in

every genre he tackled

flawlessly he gave us over 600 pieces

and he did it in half of a lifetime

there is no one ever before or since

like Mozart he is one of a kind and as

the centuries roll by he becomes even

more valid although he died from illness

at 35 on December 5th 1791 today

Mozart's influence can be heard in the

music of Bugs Bunny cartoons to rock and

roll legends such as Billy Joel and Van

Halen
