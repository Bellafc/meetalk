here hey Evelyn how are you doing great

I'm very excited Rachel me too Evelyn

it's so nice to meet you let me

introduce myself I'm Rachel I'm an

Enterprise product lead at an AI startup

called Arena uh we help uh large

Enterprises make decisions using AI

models uh before I was at Arena I was a

staff product manager at meta where I

was building uh or collaborating with

teams to build uh recommendation systems

uh personalization systems and content

Distribution Systems so that's roughly

about me and a nutshell uh why don't you

tell me a bit about

yourself yeah thank you so much Rachel

my name is Evelyn uh uh most recently I

was at corsera I was building platform

features prior to that worked at various

different companies including Uber so I

would say my expertise is really in

Marketplace and growth um right now I'm

actively interviewing and I'm super

excited that I get this opportunity to

get your a coach oh wonderful I am a

huge fan of especially corsera in these

I have taken a few classes there and

it's a wonderful platform

Evelyn let's imagine that you are a

product matter manager at meta and you

have five months sorry six months to

evaluate if meta should enter the

fitness

space got it so what what we are trying

to figure out is whether or not meta

should enter into the fitness space um

great I guess to start um I love to just

clarify a few things with you when we

say enter a new fitness space are we

thinking about potentially leveraging

some of the meta portfolio or this is a

brand new space that we are trying to

get

into so ideally if we have six months I

think it's best to use meta's

portfolio

and leverage our existing features to

see if there is value here how do you

think this aligns with meta with meta's

Direction overall what do you see as

opportunities here before we dive too

deep yeah yeah um so I think to tie back

to meta Vision which is to give people a

space so that they could build

communities and bring the whole world

close together I think the fitness base

makes a lot of sense

because how people spent time these days

are very

fragmented meta started off as a social

media Network Facebook I think nowadays

people probably spend less time because

there are so many competitors Tik Tok um

Google YouTube um so I think Fitness

could be a very strategic Li because

people are spending more time on Fitness

they probably spend more than five 10

minutes workout

than couple seconds or minute watching

social media beats so I think

strategically it makes a lot of sense

from an engagement perspective and

outside of the engagement what do you

think about the sentiment towards

Fitness or like building Community

around Fitness do you see examples where

communities are being built around

Fitness absolutely absolutely um

Community is if not the most important

one one of the most important Libra

because

people find

more motivation and interest when they

have a lot of people they could work

with and I think that's one of the power

of the Facebook or The Meta Community

there's already so many monthly and

weekly active user so I think that's

like the community piece is probably

easy to get okay okay sounds

good so I guess we touched a little bit

about the engagement I wanted to use

that as um guiding principle um in order

for me to build this Fitness product

utilizing existing Facebook or meta

portfolio I'm going to keep the

engagement in mind um then I will move

on to how I usually structure the

product sense I love to brainstorm on

who are we building this

for what their motiv ation or pinpoints

are and then from there I think I could

uh pitch a few Solutions with you and

then from there probably figure

out um metrics how to measure success

and then what the end to-end experience

look like how does that sound to you

that sounds wonderful thank you awesome

so to start with who are we building

this for

um I think of Fitness as

a I guess two-sided Marketplace um at

one hand there are uh the people who

provide content so like Supply the

content for Fitness they might be coach

uh or influencer and then on the other

hand there is the demand side which are

the audience who consume the fitness

information um when I think about supply

and demand uh there definitely more

influencers trying to enter the space

but in terms of the market size I still

think there are more

people consuming the information um so

they could become more um like more fit

or healthier so I think the demena is

where I wanted to focus on um

okay so breaking that down a a little

bit more when I think about the them men

side they're also um individual Fitness

level there might be people who are just

work out on a daily basis um that's I

would consider them like athletes and

then there are people who are just maybe

like casually working out maybe one or

two times a week and then there are

people

who either don't have a habit with they

just don't work out um and when I think

about the fitness level and where I

might have the most success I think

about how big the audience is how much

impact the fitness product could drive

and then how much effort because we are

trying to build this thing out in six

months um I think the

Casual workout people has the highest

reach

um if I build something that they use

probably will have medium to large

impact in terms of confidence meta has

so much data I could tap into um so I

think confidence-wise I can definitely

validate it how does that sound to you

wonderful I really like it and I really

like that you're giving me a bit of like

a double segmentation here orienting me

around okay what is the marketplace at a

high level then going down deeper and

then giving me a very good

prioritization method so I understand

what's guiding your selection this is

very um

helpful thank you so much so shall we

move on to maybe like focusing on the

the demand side casual workout I want to

think about their pinpoints um okay so

the pinpoints um I consider myself a

casual workout I don't do it every day

um couple of the pinpoints

um come to mind one is um just the

schedule um a lot of professionals like

working professionals um they have a

busy schedule so workout might not be

something that's already in their daily

routine so that's one the other one I

think is related to like a equipment um

workout could be many different things

um but but some requires like a punching

bag or a treadmill not everyone has

access to that and I think the third one

is

um a combination of different things but

I think the summary is

motivation uh people might not find

motivated enough um to get up in the

morning to work out or they could get

bored and then just drop out so I think

motivation

is like a summary of the pinpoint that a

lot of casual workout people might face

when they are trying to decide what to

do uh I'm going to pause right there

just to get your reaction on how do

these pin points resonate with you is

there any direction you want me to focus

a little bit more on first of all thank

you for checking in with me I think

these all make sense I think where do

you think that understanding what to do

and knowing what to do where do you

think that fits in

here I

think to help

me figure out what to do here I would

probably leverage a couple things uh the

first no no I I didn't explain myself

well I'm sorry I meant when you're

thinking about the people the Casual uh

worker

outter how do you think access to

information influences their ability to

become more fit or to meet their

goals I think it's relevant to what they

are looking for and I think meta might

have the network they can tap into to

look for the information like maybe they

can look up what their friends are doing

or they could look up to what their

coaches coach is recommending so so I

think uh the social graph I think that

might be a feature that meta is known

for is fine-tuning that connection and

the information shared among uh these

people so I definitely think the

information plays a huge part

especially in terms of information and

then how these casual workouts people

could get help from okay cool when

you're comparing and information and

motivation as two problems how do you

think about which of these is more

important to prioritize how do you go

about

that I think they are

interrelated um a lot of people lack

motivation

because they don't know where to

look it's daunting it is daunting

and a lot of people probably feel that

about meta too meta was around at least

10 plus years and over time meta has

so many products um and with each

product there's different pieces of

information so for casual workout folks

the information might be daunting so

they don't necessarily know where to

look for that help that's why I think

like the fitness is interesting and

definitely there's already a lot of

portfolio within meta that could be

built around driving the wellness and

health for the

users and when you're thinking about

these problems how would you validate

which of these problems is the most

pressing uh in terms of validation

um meta has a lot of data I definitely

wanted to tap into that uh I also would

argue there's information outside of

meta um like the trends or Market map or

even

with past covid how People's Health

habit evolve I think there's a lot of

first and thirdparty quantitative and

qualitative uh study I could study uh

look into to see if that validates my

hypothesis that information over

overload could be one of the hindrance

that prevents people to work out so it's

interesting you're saying there's both

that aspect of too much information and

not enough information at the same time

which makes it very daunting to users as

you as you said a second ago yeah the

right information having information is

not enough it has to be I think right

right place right time and right

information in

general wonderful okay so uh I think how

I might prioritize these pinpoints and

thank you for guiding me to think more

about the information versus like which

specific pinpoints might be most related

to meta's Mission and strength which is

a sea of data sea of information I would

say information plays a huge part in

terms of driving people's motivation

uh we talked about schedule we talked

about equipment but I think motivation

has that then diagram was the

information that meta already has so I

think that is the pinpoint that we can

probably build something quickly to

address I know that makes a lot of sense

I know we touched about this before but

do you think there are opportunities

here um in terms of the pain points in

terms of motivation do you think that

there's an opportunity or let me

rephrase this how do you think this

might impact the emotional connection

that people using meta have with

meta I think in emotional

connection could be elevated and I think

that could strengthen the engagement

because most meta users or Facebook or

Instagram or uh WhatsApp users use

the product for very specific purpose

like browsing people's

activity if um we are able to unlock the

motivation by providing the right

information at the right time I think

the emotional connection could be

boosted because not only um their

activity is just around possibly

browsing people's feed or images um but

it's also about having a shared

experience and I think like Fitness is a

shared experience um that could motivate

other people so emotional connection I

definitely see it trending upwards with

the fitness

Aton I love that you bring up like the

shared experiences of it because I think

it really ties to meta's Mission very

nicely yeah yeah like when I see a

friend working out and building out

sixpack I want to do that too like it's

the season of New Year resolution one

person influencing one another and we

all get like six packs right yes exactly

okay what do you want to do next ah okay

uh so tying back to the solution that

could solve for that motivation and

boost emotional connection using what we

already have in the meta portfolio uh I

think

couple

like lwh hanging fruit ideas that I had

one is around like reminder like we

touched on there are so much information

there's so many notification going on

but I think related to Fitness if we

could serve some sort of like front and

center uh popup at the time someone

needs to work out that could be a really

good uh Habit formation to motivate

people it's time to work out uh I think

tying back to the connection piece

another idea could be forming some sort

of a social workout group so if I know

uh I live in Washington DC there are

people in the same area similar age all

are interested in developing some sort

of a healthy habit we could form a group

and start working out and I think that

goes back to the emotional connection

like I'm no longer working alone I am

working out with other people so I think

that kind of a motivation could be like

double work

quadrupod um the third idea that I had

um is probably related to

the the

personalization motivation um aspect I

think because meta is investing heavily

in the arvr space with the information

the social graph it is possible to build

out some sort of like personalized

experience that can be experienced

through AR VR platform um maybe like

when I put the headset on um it's

knowing my brain waves or my my my my

heartbeat and then suggest the best kind

of workout at the moment so in terms of

like these kind of three ideas um before

you go into prioritization I have a few

question for you I love your ideas when

you're thinking about for example like

that front and center notification that

you meant and thinking about like that

social NW work group are there

opportunities to connect these together

to kind of like maybe you don't need to

schedule in advance like are there any

other do you see any opportunity here to

kind of like bring these together a

bit

absolutely um absolutely I think they

are lizing a part about personalized uh

preference and I think meta is really

good at that um as part of either like

onboarding or activation flow uh meta

could also pause

how do people want to work out do they

like to work out by themselves or do

they like to work out alone among other

people so I think those two pieces uh

can definitely connect the notification

and then the social group aspect so

let's say let me play this out for you a

bit let's say I know that you Evelyn

like to work out in a group and let's

say I know that your friend Lisa is just

about to go on a run in 15 minutes how

does this connect for you yeah yeah I

love that how I love how it plays out if

I see Lisa is going out for a

run and I'm just having a sluggish day

and I get a

notification saying hey your friend is

going for a run would you like to join

her to me that kind of a emotional

booster that we talked about is probably

going to help

me

like get out of my like oh I'm having a

sluggish day and then just put on my

shoes and join Lisa so I think those two

definitely could be a sequence one

leading to another um so yeah I think

that could play out really well on the

flip side of it what do you think is the

best the big risk

of this approach of like letting you

know that Lisa is going on a

run

uh I

think

personalized data being shared could be

one of the risk I know in the past

there's a lot of concern and gar rails

around which data do people feel

comfortable being shared what if Lisa

wants to go for a run and then all of a

sudden I run down the street and she

doesn't even wanted to see me I I think

that will ruin Lisa's experience a

little bit hopefully it doesn't ruin her

experience but yeah I it might make her

a bit question and it might be a bit

more dangerous than that as well for

sure yeah the creepiness is for sure

when you're thinking about I I love I I

love this idea of like thinking about

how we can motivate people to kind of

like Let each other know about this and

make this a bit more a social experience

when you're thinking about the VR AR

piece here and then thinking about the

social workout group I don't know let's

say it's a snowstorm outside in uh in

Boston and you still have electricity

but you're definitely not going to the

gym and there's no way you're going

running so how do you think you can tie

these things together as well yeah I

love that example because it happened to

me last week it was snowing really hard

outside and I would love to go out I

think in that case the arvr makes a lot

of sense because it solves the uh

motivation caused by external

factors if I have a headset and then if

I could build that in as part of like

hey it's six o'clock time to get up and

work out there's no excuse of not going

outside because I have a

like headset I could put on and then the

headset could would recommend something

that uh helps me work out and stay

healthy and how would you tie The

Social Network element here or like the

community piece

here yeah uh something I could see as

building into

is the social element could be the

moment I put my headset on it's

detecting that Evelyn is online and then

also simultaneously seeing who else

might also be online and then all of a

sudden maybe I am running down the

virtual track with Lisa or Luke or

whatever um I think that's where things

could come

together wonderful so we have

brainstormed a few Solutions some of

them you you brought yourself and some

of them you kind of like brainstormed a

bit with me and thank you for

collaborating with me on this what do

you think is the most impactive solution

here uh in terms of impactful solution

um I wanted to think

about personalized

experience if a person is a solo

workout then I would say

probably the

reminder is a loow hanging fruit I feel

confident to build this out uh within

the time constraint like six months and

then get it out and validate what kind

of impact it H has but if it's yes if

you H if you see that that has that

impact that you're looking for what what

direction would you want to go into

more Direction Number One um I would try

to bundle other elements so if reminder

works works great then I probably uh

would see if there are other social

element I could tie into like the social

group or um forming some sort of like

competition like friendly competition uh

with other friends um so at the same

time everybody gets like that kind of a

reminder to work out so those are a

couple ideas that could be bundled after

early success of the

impact

interesting um last question I I this

usually isn't part of what I ask in

these interviews but I'm a bit curious

how would you think about bringing this

to Market like what would you try to do

in terms of like a go to market plan to

start this if you're if you're running a

test for example are you trying to

promote this test

or how are you thinking about that

uh yeah that's a great question I think

maybe

March is the wellness awareness month I

think that could be maybe it's March

maybe it's April I'm not sure but there

is a month that's called Wellness

awareness month I did not know that

thank you for telling me that's very

creative I think that could be an

opportunity for goto

Market um and what met I could do is

leveraging this kind of

opportunity uh to make a splash in terms

of like oh like when you log on to like

um Facebook or Instagram now you can put

in um like some sort of personalized

request um if you want to be more active

using the social graph using the

information we already have about you to

not you alone on the way to set healthy

Habit to motivate you to I don't know

for me it's lose 10 10 pounds or

something like that and then rest assure

meta has a lot of data that throughout

the workout Journey um that could be a

good like value proposition where PR um

as a goto Market you you bring a a

really interesting point there bringing

the idea of weight loss and meta's

received a lot of scrutiny over you know

teenage girls and Body Image issues how

do you handle that with this kind of

experience you know when people often

tie Fitness to weight loss and that

doesn't necessarily play out well

especially for teenagers how do you

ensure safety

here I love this question and how I

would tackle it goes back to our earlier

point about emotional connection I think

a lot of

people over index on Fitness or losing

weight because they don't have a good

threshold to measure what is healthy and

there are a lot of false information on

social media I think what meta could do

is leveraging the

people beyond their immediate Network

like a lot of teenagers they see other

teenagers losing weight so they wanted

to follow suit but what meta could do is

bring in more of a trust Ed and

authoritative um voice to influence them

what health could mean whether that's

like BMI or whatever there are multiple

different ways especially with the feed

um I think meta could introduce that to

build that healthy balance and

boundaries for those who over index on

weight

loss cool yeah I think that's a very

good place to end because I think uh

it's it's something really important to

think about how do you make sure this is

a safe experience that doesn't uh cause

more harm than good so thanks for um

thinking through this with

me okay uh let's do a quick debrief um

Evelyn how do you think this felt or how

do you think this

went I had a lot of fun and I think

that's the essence of product sense

right like it doesn't feel like you

asked me a question and I have to go

through the circle framework or whatever

or use rice framework it felt like a

collaborative brainstorming process

which I really like uh I think I get a

little bit sidetracked in terms of like

connecting all the pieces together like

at one hand we're talking about

emotional connection and then there's

like the information over low I think

going back to meta's portfolio it just

they are so many things I need to

consider um so I think that's probably

one of the like feedback I would give

myself to really

clarify which existing portfolio how

that ties back to the pinpoints and user

pinpoints and then how does that like

Drive the overall outcome that we wanted

to achieve whether that's daily weekly

or whatever active

users wonderful um from my point of view

I think I really like the collaborative

aspect of this as well I think you know

people go into these product fence

interviews and they think you know oh I

need to know everything and I need to

lead the interview but the fact is it's

very collaborative in my opinion and one

of the key things that our evaluated on

is you know how do you are how coachable

are you how do you respond to the

interviewer's nudges and I really liked

how you responded um to the nudges that

I gave you you know if I'm thinking

about you know what are the five things

that you get evaluated on in a product

sense

interview uh actually before I go there

in my opinion a product sense interview

is about taking an ambiguous problem

statement and turning it into an

actionable hypothesis or solution or

product Vision right and I think you

accomplished a lot of this here right

you were able to tie this to meta's

Mission and think about you know and

when I pushed you on it um you were able

to um iterate with me a bit to get to

understanding and not just the metrics

but what does it mean for the emotional

connection what does it mean for the

social network of being able to build

community Through Fitness right the

second piece audience uh definition I

really like that you took me through a

top down approach of showing me the

market like the overall ecosystem and

then prioritizing a specific set of

users with a framework I could follow

problem identification I think there it

was really cool to see how we iterated a

bit with each other um trying to clarify

a bit more of how you're thinking about

two different uh problems and then kind

of

like nailing down the problem that you

want to solve and then the solution

exploration um I think there you had

really great ideas the one thing I would

say there is I would want to see the the

The Social Network piece not just the

social graph but the social network and

the Mission Guide a bit more through the

solution space which is fine it's

something that's hard to come up with

and as you said yourself there's a bit

of a risk here because for example for

your notification framework if Lisa

doesn't want other people to know that

Lisa is working out then you know we

probably shouldn't do that so but I

think also like the idea of oh who's

online when you're with your headsets on

as like as a way to work out that kind

of like gives me a longer term Vision

meaning okay you start with a

notification and then you think about

building out the VR headset which ties

up very nicely um um with the with the

six months Horizon um it was pretty easy

to follow you I think at some points you

may have been a bit nervous which is

very natural in these cases and you know

nobody is perfect in communicating pom

pom pom unless they pretty much wrote

down the solution step by step word by

word it's not realistic to think about

and I did throw a wrench at you actually

threw two wrenches at you in the end the

first one was how you take it to Market

which is usually we don't have time for

these questions but I Lov your idea of

the fitness awareness month as like a

moment here um so I thought that was

super fun and I thought you know the

conversation of like how do you think

about safety and teen safety in terms of

this problem I think it's a really

important uh thing to solve so overall I

had a lot of fun with you and I hope you

enjoyed this as
