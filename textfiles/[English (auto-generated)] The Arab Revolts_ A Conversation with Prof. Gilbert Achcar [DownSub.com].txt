if i may start by introducing uh

professor ashgar

um

professor eshkai works at sowes in

london has previously worked in beirut

paris and berlin he is the author of a

number of books i think i've read most

of them

one book for example on the arab spring

it just

i just received the new edition oh very

nice so they have the new edition of the

aerospring updated yeah yeah with that

new preface the yeah

perfect the people want

um i also read the book on the arabs and

the holocaust which is about the

reception of the holocaust in the arab

world as well as a number of others one

uh interview book with norm chomsky so

all in all i'm quite indebted to jubeir

for teaching me a few things

about the region and of course he's also

been my phd supervisor which is why um

we know each other

my first question

you are very critical of the role of

neoliberalism in the middle east and not

africa so do you think that

neoliberalism

never works for development or do you

think that there's something specific

about the middle east which is why

neoliberalism has failed as a recipe

for development

well

first of all i mean

if you're asking me the question it's

that's because you read the my book

where i discuss this

this issue

and what i say is basically that to

explain the situation in the middle east

and north africa

only by neoliberalism

is

not a convincing explanation because

then some people could point

to

some

countries of the global thousands which

achieved

much better results than the arab

countries

while following neoliberal

recipes

india for instance

turkey if we if we consider turkey to be

part of the global house

chile or whatever you have a number of

countries

where

basically the same general neoliberal

recipes were followed but which achieved

very different

results in development industrialization

and the rest

so the issue here is that

in the

arab countries and i would say also in

many other countries of the global house

there are no conditions

of the type that

would allow

for

some

development

under the neoliberal

conditions

and because these conditions

neoliberalism is a dogmatic

perspective which is based on an

idealist

or idealized

version of capitalism

so it presupposes

the

ideal

capitalism you want

which does not really exist

of free market free competition

etc

well we are very very very far from that

in

the

in the arab countries where you have

dominance by states by

ruling groups

with a lot of crony capitalism nepotism

and rest

which makes this whole

recipe

failed

this is a

the neoliberal view is based on the

dogmatic principle that the private

sector

should be the driving force of the

economy

now

most successful

developmental stories were stories where

the state

the public sector played a key role

and that also applies to china which has

the

uh most impressive rates of development

uh

china has been characterized by a major

role in the public sector in investment

so what happened in classical countries

like the arab countries where the

neoliberal model was imposed

what happened is that public investment

was

curtailed very much diminished reduced

with the idea that the private

investment would

would compensate this didn't happen

and therefore you have this very low

growth

and record rates of uh unemployment

youth

the highest rates of use unemployment in

the world

so

there are some conditions in some

countries where you have a dynamic

private sector of medium

enterprises rest

where the

export-led model

under neoliberal conditions

may

work

but these are

more

exceptions than the rule

for the global house

or at least there are specific cases but

you have so many other cases where the

neoliberal model failed completely

[Music]

and even

when it

succeeds

the rates of growth are much less

impressive than those

of the developmentalist

era

when the state was leading development

one

two

unlike the developmentalist era

where social inequalities were reduced

the neoliberal model of development even

when it is successful

goes along with a huge increase in

social inequalities

between the richest and the poorest in

society

so that's what we can say about this

yeah so you would argue that state

investment did go down in the middle

east but private

investment didn't come come up basically

this the state wasn't replaced um with

private

force so it's really a question about uh

statehood and other states are

made up right i mean in the in the

middle east we don't have this barbarian

type of legal rational impersonal

state right and you write this a lot

could you maybe like characterize the

arab state or the predominance of um

there is no the around state yeah

there are arab states

right

and a variety of them but they fall into

two patterns

first

you have

patrimonial states fully patrimonial

states

where the

ruling group

owns the state completely as if in

absolute monarchies

well you have eight monarchies anyway in

the arab world and they are all

basically absolute monarchies even when

they have parliaments because the

sovereignty is

the king's

prerogative so the king can get rid of

parliament or whatever they want or the

emir whatever the type

and then

and that includes also so-called repub

republics like uh

syria of the assets

or libya of gaddafi before he he got uh

overthrown and uh and killed

uh these were also patrimonian states

because although they called themselves

republics but they were exactly like

monarchies with ruling family

completely owning the state and

transmitting power by

you know hereditary

um and then you have neo-patrimonial

states that are states where

um

there is

some

i mean there is a distance between the

institution of the state and the ruling

group

so there is no ownership of the state by

any group

but there is the collective institution

which in some cases is the army

three arab countries egypt sudan and

algeria are ruled by the army

so in such countries the the army can

remove the president when the president

is discredited

whereas in the patrimonial state

the the president ordered that ruling

the rulers king president whatever they

are controlled completely the

the armed forces through family links

through tribe buildings

sectarian links whatever so these you

have these two categories and all these

states

are to a certain degree round-tier state

economically which gives their

that gives the state

even more autonomy

vis-a-vis society

[Music]

so

these are the features of the

system of states in the arab

world which means

even the neocatrimonial state have a

higher even degree of nepotism and

chronism

than

other neo-patrimonial states in the

global south

so these conditions explain why the

neoliberal

idea that the private sector would

would perform miracles

failed completely because private money

does not go does not take risks under

such conditions and does not go into

[Music]

long-term heavy investment

it seeks quick profit

and you have a lot of capital flight a

lot of

money leaving the region going to fiscal

paradise

you know panama

whatever switzerland

the rest

so that's that's what you have

thank you so the the revolution of the

revolts of 2 10 to 11 didn't really

manage to capture those states be it

patrimonial neo-patrimonial right

and i remember quite well like watching

these revolves also being in egypt

the sense of hope after they occurred

right or whilst they were occurring

this sense of hope has been replaced

with a sense of despair i think it's

fair to say even though the revolts were

sort of like on ongoing and we've seen

recent waves of revolts as well

so could you name the main factors that

explain the the lack of success so to

say in capturing the state and

transforming society

um

well i would say despair

the fight is going on

[Music]

even in a country like syria which has

gone through the worst tragedy of all

countries

even there you can see even the areas

controlled by the regime you still have

social protests going on in the rest

[Music]

in sudan the fight is still going on

the popular movement is still fighting

and overall

i mean

even when

people have suffered suffered defeats

like in egypt

the anger is just growing and

i think it's it should be rather

clear that

there is no

stability in the long run in any of the

region's countries

so what started in 2011 is what i call

the long-term revolutionary process

which would will go on like historical

revolutionary processes

uh even in if you take single countries

like

france china

i mean the revolution went through

various phases

for instance 1911 and china you had

something from 1825 19 then you had the

liberation war and

1949 etc it's a it's a long-term process

france

for some historians france only reached

some so i mean

its transformation essentially after the

french revolution we began in 1789

a little less than a century

uh so

so here we're speaking not of one

country we're speaking of uh an assembly

of countries so maybe the

the comparison should be with western

europe

how long it took for western europe to

move from

monarchy's absolutist monarchies into

modern

democratic regimes

[Music]

so

of course

in our

era in our time

[Music]

history goes much faster

and

but it will take decades it has already

taken

i mean

since it started 13 years we've had

already two waves one in 2011.

six countries

have major uprisings

one in 2019 four more countries

and

one could even add a fifth which is

jordan in 2018.

so you have

at least 10 countries

representing half the states of the

region half the states of the region

have gone through major uprisings so

just imagine the same in in western

europe yeah

just imagine that

uh so it gives you an idea of the scope

of what's going on and it will carry on

it will carry on there will be further

weeks there will be

more absurd and more backlash there will

be more revolution and more counter

revolution that's the dialectics of

history

in history

in long-term processes

until

one of two things either the region

finds

uh

i mean

either

uh

some leaderships emerge that can

lead the

change to success

and therefore put their countries on the

track of new development

or

or

you will have more of the tragic

spiral of violence that we have seen in

recent years
