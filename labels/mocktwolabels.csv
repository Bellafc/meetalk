"I have taken a few classes there, and it's a wonderful platform. Evelyn, let's imagine that you are a product manager at Meta, and you have six months to evaluate if Meta should enter the fitness space. Got it. So, what we are trying to figure out is whether or not Meta should enter the fitness space.",ChapterIntroduction下的SectionParticipant,ChapterIntroduction下的SectionParticipant
"So, what we are trying to figure out is whether or not Meta should enter the fitness space. Great! I guess to start, I'd love to just clarify a few things with you. When we say ""enter the fitness space,"" are we thinking about potentially leveraging some of the Meta portfolio, or is this a brand new space that we are trying to get into? So, ideally, if we have six months, I think it's best to use Meta's portfolio and leverage our existing features to see if there is value here.",ChapterIntroduction下的SectionInterviewquestion,ChapterIntroduction下的SectionInterviewquestion
"So, ideally, if we have six months, I think it's best to use Meta's portfolio and leverage our existing features to see if there is value here. How do you think this aligns with Meta's direction overall? What do you see as opportunities here before we dive too deep? Yeah, I think to tie back to Meta's vision, which is to give people a space so that they could build communities and bring the whole world closer together, I think the fitness space makes a lot of sense.",ChapterIntroduction下的SectionInterviewquestion,ChapterIntroduction下的SectionInterviewquestion
"Yeah, I think to tie back to Meta's vision, which is to give people a space so that they could build communities and bring the whole world closer together, I think the fitness space makes a lot of sense. Because how people spend time these days is very fragmented. Meta started off as a social media network, Facebook. I think nowadays people probably spend less time on it because there are so many competitors like TikTok, Google, YouTube.",ChapterIntroduction下的SectionInterviewquestion,ChapterIntroduction下的SectionInterviewquestion
"I think nowadays people probably spend less time on it because there are so many competitors like TikTok, Google, YouTube. So, I think fitness could be very strategic because people are spending more time on fitness. They probably spend more than five to ten minutes working out than a couple of seconds or a minute watching social media bits. So, I think strategically it makes a lot of sense from an engagement perspective.",ChapterIntroduction下的SectionInterviewquestion,ChapterIntroduction下的SectionInterviewquestion
"So, I think strategically it makes a lot of sense from an engagement perspective. And outside of the engagement, what do you think about the sentiment towards fitness or building a community around fitness? Do you see examples where communities are being built around fitness? Absolutely, absolutely.",ChapterIntroduction下的SectionInterviewquestion,ChapterIntroduction下的SectionInterviewquestion
"I wanted to use that as a guiding principle. In order for me to build this fitness product utilizing the existing Facebook or Meta portfolio, I'm going to keep the engagement in mind. Then I will move on to how I usually structure the product sense. I love to brainstorm on who we are building this for, what their motivations or pain points are, and then from there, I think I could pitch a few solutions with you.",ChapterAnalysis下的SectionStructureandgoals,ChapterAnalysis下的SectionStructureandgoals
"I love to brainstorm on who we are building this for, what their motivations or pain points are, and then from there, I think I could pitch a few solutions with you. And then from there, probably figure out metrics, how to measure success, and then what the end-to-end experience looks like. How does that sound to you? That sounds wonderful, thank you.",ChapterAnalysis下的SectionStructureandgoals,ChapterAnalysis下的SectionStructureandgoals
"That sounds wonderful, thank you. Awesome. So, to start with, who are we building this for? I think of fitness as a two-sided marketplace.",ChapterAnalysis下的SectionStructureandgoals,ChapterAnalysis下的SectionStructureandgoals
"I think of fitness as a two-sided marketplace. On one hand, there are the people who provide content, so like supply the content for fitness. They might be coaches or influencers. And then on the other hand, there is the demand side, which are the audience who consume the fitness information.",ChapterAnalysis下的SectionStructureandgoals,ChapterAnalysis下的SectionStructureandgoals
"And then on the other hand, there is the demand side, which are the audience who consume the fitness information. When I think about supply and demand, there are definitely more influencers trying to enter the space, but in terms of the market size, I still think there are more people consuming the information so they could become more fit or healthier. So, I think the demand is where I want to focus on. Okay, so breaking that down a little bit more, when I think about the demand side, there are also individual fitness levels.",ChapterAnalysis下的SectionStructureandgoals,ChapterAnalysis下的SectionStructureandgoals
"Okay, so breaking that down a little bit more, when I think about the demand side, there are also individual fitness levels. There might be people who work out on a daily basis. I would consider them athletes. And then there are people who are just maybe casually working out maybe one or two times a week.",ChapterAnalysis下的SectionStructureandgoals,ChapterAnalysis下的SectionStructureandgoals
"And then there are people who are just maybe casually working out maybe one or two times a week. And then there are people who either don't have a habit or they just don't work out. When I think about the fitness level and where I might have the most success, I think about how big the audience is, how much impact the fitness product could drive, and then how much effort, because we are trying to build this thing out in six months. I think the casual workout people have the highest reach.",ChapterAnalysis下的SectionStructureandgoals,ChapterAnalysis下的SectionStructureandgoals
"I think the casual workout people have the highest reach. If I build something that they use, it probably will have medium to large impact. In terms of confidence, Meta has so much data I could tap into, so I think confidence-wise I can definitely validate it. How does that sound to you?",ChapterAnalysis下的SectionStructureandgoals,ChapterAnalysis下的SectionStructureandgoals
"How does that sound to you? Wonderful. I really like it, and I really like that you're giving me a bit of a double segmentation here, orienting me around what is the marketplace at a high level, then going down deeper, and then giving me a very good prioritization method, so I understand what's guiding your selection. This is very helpful.",ChapterAnalysis下的SectionStructureandgoals,ChapterAnalysis下的SectionStructureandgoals
"This is very helpful. Thank you so much. So, shall we move on to maybe focusing on the demand side, casual workout? I want to think about their pain points.",ChapterAnalysis下的SectionPainpoints,ChapterAnalysis下的SectionPainpoints
"I don't do it every day. A couple of pain points come to mind. One is the schedule. A lot of professionals, like working professionals, have a busy schedule, so working out might not be something that's already in their daily routine.",ChapterAnalysis下的SectionPainpoints,ChapterAnalysis下的SectionPainpoints
"A lot of professionals, like working professionals, have a busy schedule, so working out might not be something that's already in their daily routine. That's one. The other one I think is related to equipment. Working out could be many different things, but some require a punching bag or a treadmill.",ChapterAnalysis下的SectionPainpoints,ChapterAnalysis下的SectionPainpoints
"Working out could be many different things, but some require a punching bag or a treadmill. Not everyone has access to that. And I think the third one is a combination of different things, but I think the summary is motivation. People might not find enough motivation to get up in the morning to work out, or they could get bored and then just drop out.",ChapterAnalysis下的SectionPainpoints,ChapterAnalysis下的SectionPainpoints
"It's the season of New Year resolutions, one person influencing another, and we all get six-packs, right? Yes, exactly. Okay, what do you want to do next? Okay, tying back to the solution that could solve for that motivation and boost emotional connection using what we already have in the Meta portfolio, I think there are a couple of low-hanging fruit ideas that I had.",ChapterConclusion下的SectionSolution,ChapterConclusion下的SectionSolution
"Okay, tying back to the solution that could solve for that motivation and boost emotional connection using what we already have in the Meta portfolio, I think there are a couple of low-hanging fruit ideas that I had. One is around reminders. Like we touched on, there is so much information, there are so many notifications going on, but I think related to fitness, if we could serve some sort of front and center popup at the time someone needs to work out, that could be a really good habit formation to motivate people. It's time to work out.",ChapterConclusion下的SectionSolution,ChapterConclusion下的SectionSolution
"It's time to work out. I think tying back to the connection piece, another idea could be forming some sort of social workout group. If I know I live in Washington DC, there are people in the same area, similar age, all interested in developing some sort of healthy habit, we could form a group and start working out. I think that goes back to the emotional connection.",ChapterConclusion下的SectionSolution,ChapterConclusion下的SectionSolution
"I think that goes back to the emotional connection. Like, I'm no longer working alone, I am working out with other people. So, I think that kind of motivation could be double or quadruple. The third idea that I had is probably related to the personalization and motivation aspect.",ChapterConclusion下的SectionSolution,ChapterConclusion下的SectionSolution
"The third idea that I had is probably related to the personalization and motivation aspect. I think because Meta is investing heavily in the AR/VR space, with the information and the social graph, it is possible to build out some sort of personalized experience that can be experienced through AR/VR platforms. Maybe when I put the headset on, it's knowing my brain waves or my heartbeat and then suggests the best kind of workout at the moment. So, in terms of these three ideas.",ChapterConclusion下的SectionSolution,ChapterConclusion下的SectionSolution
"You bring up a really interesting point there, bringing the idea of weight loss. Meta has received a lot of scrutiny over teenage girls and body image issues. How do you handle that with this kind of experience? You know, when people often tie fitness to weight loss, and that doesn’t necessarily play out well, especially for teenagers.",ChapterConclusion下的SectionGo-to-MarketPlan,ChapterConclusion下的SectionGo-to-MarketPlan
"You know, when people often tie fitness to weight loss, and that doesn’t necessarily play out well, especially for teenagers. How do you ensure safety here? I love this question. How I would tackle it goes back to our earlier point about emotional connection.",ChapterConclusion下的SectionGo-to-MarketPlan,ChapterConclusion下的SectionGo-to-MarketPlan
How I would tackle it goes back to our earlier point about emotional connection. A lot of people over-index on fitness or losing weight because they don’t have a good threshold to measure what is healthy. There’s a lot of false information on social media. I think what Meta could do is leverage people beyond their immediate network.,ChapterConclusion下的SectionGo-to-MarketPlan,ChapterConclusion下的SectionSolution
"It is daunting. And a lot of people probably feel that about Meta too. Meta has been around for at least ten plus years, and over time, Meta has so many products. With each product, there's different pieces of information.",ChapterAnalysis下的SectionPainpoints,ChapterAnalysis下的SectionPainpoints

"com. So, given that's the company mission, in my mind, our product mission statement should be building a product that caters to the needs of kids and makes it easy for them to access and buy what they need. It could be a hardware-based product, software, or it could even be a physical product. How does that sort of sound as an approach?",ChapterIntroduction下的SectionInterviewquestion,ChapterIntroduction下的SectionInterviewquestion

"I also would argue there's information outside of Meta, like trends or market maps or even with post-COVID how people's health habits evolved. I think there's a lot of first and third-party quantitative and qualitative studies I could look into to see if that validates my hypothesis that information overload could be one of the hindrances that prevent people from working out. So, it's interesting you're saying there's both that aspect of too much information and not enough information at the same time, which makes it very daunting to users, as you said a second ago. Yeah, the right information.",ChapterAnalysis下的SectionSolution,ChapterAnalysis下的SectionSolution
